Question,Answer
Who is at risk for Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)? ?,"LCMV infections can occur after exposure to fresh urine, droppings, saliva, or nesting materials from infected rodents. Transmission may also occur when these materials are directly introduced into broken skin, the nose, the eyes, or the mouth, or presumably, via the bite of an infected rodent. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported, with the exception of vertical transmission from infected mother to fetus, and rarely, through organ transplantation."
What are the treatments for Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) ?,"Aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis requires hospitalization and supportive treatment based on severity. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, may be considered under specific circumstances. Although studies have shown that ribavirin, a drug used to treat several other viral diseases, is effective against LCMV in vitro, there is no established evidence to support its routine use for treatment of LCM in humans."
What is (are) Parasites - Cysticercosis ?,"Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the parasite Taenia solium. This infection occurs after a person swallows tapeworm eggs. The larvae get into tissues such as muscle and brain, and form cysts there (these are called cysticerci). When cysts are found in the brain, the condition is called neurocysticercosis."
What are the treatments for Parasites - Cysticercosis ?,Some people with cysticercosis do not need to be treated. There are medications available to treat cysticercosis for those who do need treatment. Sometimes surgery may be needed. Your doctor will advise you on which treatment is best for you.

What are the treatments for Multiple System Atrophy ?,"There is no cure for MSA. Currently, there are no treatments to delay the progress of neurodegeneration in the brain. But there are treatments available to help people cope with some of the more disabling symptoms of MSA. In some individuals, levodopa may improve motor function, but the benefit may not continue as the disease progresses."
What is the outlook for Multiple System Atrophy ?,"The disease tends to advance rapidly over the course of 5 to 10 years, with progressive loss of motor skills, eventual confinement to bed, and death. There is no remission from the disease. There is currently no cure."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Multiple System Atrophy ?,"The NINDS supports research about MSA through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Researchers hope to learn why alpha-synuclein buildup occurs in MSA and Parkinsons disease, and how to prevent it. Drugs that reduce the abnormal alpha-synuclein buildup may be promising treatments for MSA"
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Giant Axonal Neuropathy ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) supports research related to GAN through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure inherited neurological disorders such as GAN."
What is the outlook for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome ?,"The outcome for individuals with TOS varies according to type. The majority of individuals with TOS will improve with exercise and physical therapy. Vascular TOS, and true neurogenic TOS often require surgery to relieve pressure on the affected vessel or nerve."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome ?,The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes at the National Institutes of Health support research in TOS through grants to major medical research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to diagnose and treat TOS.
What are the treatments for Angelman Syndrome ?,"There is no specific therapy for Angelman syndrome. Medical therapy for seizures is usually necessary. Physical and occupational therapies, communication therapy, and behavioral therapies are important in allowing individuals with Angelman syndrome to reach their maximum developmental potential."
What is the outlook for Angelman Syndrome ?,"Most individuals with Angelman syndrome will have severe developmental delays, speech limitations, and motor difficulties. However, individuals with Angelman syndrome can have normal life spans and generally do not show developmental regression as they age. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions and therapies help improve quality of life."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Angelman Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on neurogenetic disorders such as Angelman syndrome, to develop techniques to diagnose, treat, prevent, and ultimately cure them."
What are the treatments for Inclusion Body Myositis ?,"There is no cure for IBM, nor is there a standard course of treatment. The disease is generally unresponsive to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. Some evidence suggests that intravenous immunoglobulin may have a slight, but short-lasting, beneficial effect in a small number of cases. Physical therapy may be helpful in maintaining mobility. Other therapy is symptomatic and supportive."
What is the outlook for Inclusion Body Myositis ?,IBM is generally resistant to all therapies and its rate of progression appears to be unaffected by currently available treatments.
What are the treatments for Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis ?,"Currently, there is no cure for SSPE. Clinical trials of antiviral (isoprinosine and ribavirin) and immunomodulatory (interferon alpha) drugs have suggested that these types of therapies given alone or in combination halt the progression of the disease and can prolong life, but their long-term effects on individuals, and eventual outcome, are unknown. Good nursing care is the most important aspect of treatment for SSPE, along with anticonvulsant and antispasmodic drugs when needed."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes at the National Institutes of Health conduct research related to SSPE in their clinics and laboratories and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat and ultimately cure SSPE."
What are the treatments for Hemifacial Spasm ?,"Surgical treatment in the form of microvascular decompression, which relieves pressure on the facial nerve, will relieve hemifacial spasm in many cases. This intervention has significant potential side-effects, so risks and benefits have to be carefully balanced. Other treatments include injections of botulinum toxin into the affected areas, which is the most effective therapy and the only one used in most cases. Drug therapy is generally not effective."
What is the outlook for Hemifacial Spasm ?,"The prognosis for an individual with hemifacial spasm depends on the treatment and their response. Some individuals will become relatively free from symptoms with injection therapy. Some may require surgery. In most cases, a balance can be achieved, with tolerable residual symptoms."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hemifacial Spasm ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts and supports research related to hemifacial spams through grants to major research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure neurological disorders, such as hemifacial spasm."
What are the treatments for Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy ?,"There is no specific treatmentfor OPCA. Physicians may try different medications to treat the ataxia, tremor, and rigidity that are associated with the disorder. Other treatments are directed at specific symptoms. Stiffness, spasms, sleep disorders, depression, and tremor may be improved with medication. A physical therapist may be helpful in establishing a routine of exercise and stretching, and in obtaining devices or appliances to assist in walking and other daily activities."
What is the outlook for Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy ?,There is no cure for OPCA. The disorder is slowly progressive with death usually occurring approximately 20 years after onset.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts a broad range of basic and clinical research on cerebellar degeneration, including work aimed at finding the cause(s) of OPCA and ways to treat, cure, and, ultimately, prevent the disease. There has been great progress recently since the genes for several of the hereditary forms of OPCA have been found."
What are the treatments for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy ?,"Treatment for multifocal motor neuropathy varies. Some individuals experience only mild, modest symptoms and require no treatment. For others, treatment generally consists of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide."
What is the outlook for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy ?,"Improvement in muscle strength usually begins within 3 to 6 weeks after treatment is started. Most patients who receive treatment early experience little, if any, disability. However, there is evidence of slow progression over many years."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy ?,"The NINDS supports a broad range of research on neuromuscular disorders with the goal of finding ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure them."
What are the treatments for Occipital Neuralgia ?,"Treatment is generally symptomatic and includes massage and rest. In some cases, antidepressants may be used when the pain is particularly severe. Other treatments may include local nerve blocks and injections of steroids directly into the affected area."
What is the outlook for Occipital Neuralgia ?,"Occipital neuralgia is not a life-threatening condition. Many individuals will improve with therapy involving heat, rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and muscle relaxants. Recovery is usually complete after the bout of pain has ended and the nerve damage repaired or lessened."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Occipital Neuralgia ?,The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes at the National Institutes of Health conduct research related to pain and occipital neuralgia in their clinics and laboratories and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on understanding the basic mechanisms of pain and testing treatments in order to find better ways to treat occipital neuralgia.
What are the treatments for Arachnoiditis ?,"Arachnoiditis remains a difficult condition to treat, and long-term outcomes are unpredictable. Most treatments for arachnoiditis are focused on pain relief and the improvement of symptoms that impair daily function. A regimen of pain management, physiotheraphy, exercise, and psychotheraphy is often recommended. Surgical intervention is controversial since the outcomes are generally poor and provide only short-term relief."
What is the outlook for Arachnoiditis ?,Arachnoiditis is adisorder that causes chronic pain and neurological deficits and does not improve significantly with treatment.Surgery may only provide temporary relief. The outlook for someone witharachnoiditis iscomplicated by the fact that the disorder has no predictable pattern or severity of symptoms.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Arachnoiditis ?,"Within the NINDS research programs, arachnoiditis is addressed primarily through studies associated with pain research. NINDS vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments for pain and nerve damage with the ultimate goal of reversing debilitating conditions such as arachnoiditis."
What are the treatments for Craniosynostosis ?,"Treatment for craniosynostosis generally consists of surgery to improve the symmetry and appearance of the head and to relieve pressure on the brain and the cranial nerves. For some children with less severe problems, cranial molds can reshape the skull to accommodate brain growth and improve the appearance of the head."
What is the outlook for Craniosynostosis ?,The prognosis for craniosynostosis varies depending on whether single or multiple cranial sutures are involved or other abnormalities are present. The prognosis is better for those with single suture involvement and no associated abnormalities.
What is the outlook for Cavernous Malformation ?,"Rebleeding from a cavernous angioma is common, it is not predictable, and individuals frequently have multiple CCMs found via magnetic resonance imaging. Individuals with CCM are faced with a diagnosis that imparts risk of multiple future hemorrhages that occur seemingly at random and without any preventative therapy except surgical removal."
What are the treatments for Locked-In Syndrome ?,"There is no cure for locked-in syndrome, nor is there a standard course of treatment. A therapy called functional neuromuscular stimulation, which uses electrodes to stimulate muscle reflexes, may help activate some paralyzed muscles. Several devices to help communication are available. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."
What is the outlook for Locked-In Syndrome ?,"While in rare cases some patients may regain certain functions, the chances for motor recovery are very limited."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Locked-In Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports research on neurological disorders that can cause locked-in syndrome. The goals of this research are to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders."
What are the treatments for Machado-Joseph Disease ?,Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics under the supervision of a physician.
What is the outlook for Machado-Joseph Disease ?,"Most individuals with Lyme disease respond well to antibiotics and have full recovery. In a small percentage of individuals, symptoms may continue or recur, requiring additional antibiotic treatment. Varying degrees of permanent joint or nervous system damage may develop in individuals with late-stage Lyme disease."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Machado-Joseph Disease ?,"The NINDS supports research on Lyme disease. Current areas of interest include improving diagnostic tests and developing more effective treatments. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), and the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), all parts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), also support research on Lyme disease."
What are the treatments for Acid Lipase Disease ?,"Enzyme replacement therapy for both Wolman's and cholesteryl ester storage disease is currently under investigation. Certain drugs may be given to help with adrenal gland production, and children may need to be fed intravenously. Individuals with CESD may benefit from a low cholesterol diet."
What is the outlook for Acid Lipase Disease ?,"Wolmans disease is usually fatal by age 1. The onset and course of cholesteryl ester storage disease varies, and individuals may live into adulthood."
What are the treatments for Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum ?,"There is no standard course of treatment for ACC. Treatment usually involves management of symptoms and seizures if they occur. Associated difficulties are much more manageable with early recognition and therapy, especially therapies focusing on left/right coordination. Early diagnosis and interventions are currently the best treatments to improve social and developmental outcomes."
What is the outlook for Trigeminal Neuralgia ?,"The disorder is characterized by recurrences and remissions, and successive recurrences may incapacitate the patient. Due to the intensity of the pain, even the fear of an impending attack may prevent activity. Trigeminal neuralgia is not fatal."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Trigeminal Neuralgia ?,"Within the NINDS research programs, trigeminal neuralgia is addressed primarily through studies associated with pain research. NINDS vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments for pain and nerve damage with the ultimate goal of reversing debilitating conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia. NINDS has notified research investigators that it is seeking grant applications both in basic and clinical pain research."
What are the treatments for Neuronal Migration Disorders ?,"Treatment is symptomatic, and may include anti-seizure medication and special or supplemental education consisting of physical, occupational, and speech therapies."
What is the outlook for Neuronal Migration Disorders ?,The prognosis for children with NMDs varies depending on the specific disorder and the degree of brain abnormality and subsequent neurological signs and symptoms.
What are the treatments for Autism ?,"There is no cure for autism. Therapies and behavioral interventions are designed to remedy specific symptoms and can bring about substantial improvement. The ideal treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that meet the specific needs of individual children. Treatment options include educational/bahavioral interventions, medications, and other therapies. Most professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better."
What are the treatments for SUNCT Headache ?,"These headaches are generally non-responsive to usual treatment for other short-lasting headaches. Corticosteroids and the anti-epileptic drugs gabapentin, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine may help relieve some symptoms in some patients. Studies have shown that injections of glycerol to block nerve signaling along the trigeminal nerve may provide temporary relief in some severe cases, but the headaches recurred in about 40 percent of individuals studied."
What is the outlook for SUNCT Headache ?,There is no cure for these headaches. The disorder is not fatal but can cause considerable discomfort.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for SUNCT Headache ?,"The NINDS conducts a wide range of research on headache disorders. This research aims to discover ways to better diagnose, treat, and ultimately, prevent these disorders."
What are the treatments for Dyslexia ?,The main focus of treatment should be on the specific learning problems of affected individuals. The usual course is to modify teaching methods and the educational environment to meet the specific needs of the individual with dyslexia.
What is the outlook for Dyslexia ?,"For those with dyslexia, the prognosis is mixed. The disability affects such a wide range of people and produces such different symptoms and varying degrees of severity that predictions are hard to make. The prognosis is generally good, however, for individuals whose dyslexia is identified early, who have supportive family and friends and a strong self-image, and who are involved in a proper remediation program."
What are the treatments for Aphasia ?,"In some instances, an individual will completely recover from aphasia without treatment. In most cases, however, language therapy should begin as soon as possible and be tailored to the individual needs of the person. Rehabilitation with a speech pathologist involves extensive exercises in which individuals read, write, follow directions, and repeat what they hear. Computer-aided therapy may supplement standard language therapy."
What is the outlook for Aphasia ?,"The outcome of aphasia is difficult to predict given the wide range of variability of the condition. Generally, people who are younger or have less extensive brain damage fare better. The location of the injury is also important and is another clue to prognosis. In general, people tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Aphasia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders conduct and support a broad range of scientific investigations to increase our understanding of aphasia, find better treatments, and discover improved methods to restore lost function to people who have aphasia."
What are the treatments for Colpocephaly ?,"There is no definitive treatment for colpocephaly. Anticonvulsant medications are often prescribed to prevent seizures, and doctors rely on exercise therapies and orthopedic appliances to reduce shrinkage or shortening of muscles."
What is the outlook for Colpocephaly ?,The prognosis for individuals with colpocephaly depends on the severity of the associated conditions and the degree of abnormal brain development. Some children benefit from special education.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Colpocephaly ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conduct research related to colpocephaly and other cephalic disorders in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding ways to prevent brain abnormalities such as colpocephaly."
What are the treatments for Benign Essential Blepharospasm ?,In most cases of BEB the treatment of choice is botulinum toxin injections which relax the muscles and stop the spasms. Other treatment options include medications (drug therapy) or surgery--either local surgery of the eye muscles or deep brain stimulation surgery.
What is the outlook for Benign Essential Blepharospasm ?,"With botulinum toxin treatment most individuals with BEB have substantial relief of symptoms. Although some may experience side effects such as drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, and eye dryness, these side effects are usually only temporary. The condition may worsen or expand to surrounding muscles; remain the same for many years; and, in rare cases, improve spontaneously."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Benign Essential Blepharospasm ?,"The NINDS supports a broad program of research on disorders of the nervous system, including BEB. Much of this research is aimed at increasing understanding of these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What is the outlook for Polymyositis ?,"The prognosis for polymyositis varies. Most people respond fairly well to therapy, but some have a more severe disease that does not respond adequately to therapies and are left with significant disability. In rare cases individuals with severe and progressive muscle weakness will develop respiratory failure or pneumonia. Difficulty swallowing may cause weight loss and malnutrition."
What are the treatments for Wallenberg's Syndrome ?,"Treatment for Wallenberg's syndrome is symptomatic. A feeding tube may be necessary if swallowing is very difficult. Speech/swallowing therapy may be beneficial. In some cases, medication may be used to reduce or eliminate pain. Some doctors report that the anti-epileptic drug gabapentin appears to be an effective medication for individuals with chronic pain."
What is the outlook for Wallenberg's Syndrome ?,The outlook for someone with Wallenbergs syndrome depends upon the size and location of the area of the brain stem damaged by the stroke. Some individuals may see a decrease in their symptoms within weeks or months. Others may be left with significant neurological disabilities for years after the initial symptoms appeared.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Wallenberg's Syndrome ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to Wallenbergs syndrome in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as Wallenbergs syndrome."
What are the treatments for Monomelic Amyotrophy ?,There is no cure for MMA. Treatment consists of muscle strengthening exercises and training in hand coordination
What is the outlook for Monomelic Amyotrophy ?,"The symptoms of MMA usually progress slowly for one to two years before reaching a plateau, and then remain stable for many years. Disability is generally slight. Rarely, the weakness progresses to the opposite limb. There is also a slowly progressive variant of MMA known as O'Sullivan-McLeod syndrome, which only affects the small muscles of the hand and forearm and has a slowly progressive course."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Monomelic Amyotrophy ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports a broad range of research on motor neuron diseases. The goals of these studies are to increase understanding of these disorders and to find ways to treat, prevent, and ultimately cure them."
What are the treatments for Gerstmann's Syndrome ?,"There is no cure for Gerstmann's syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Occupational and speech therapies may help diminish the dysgraphia and apraxia. In addition, calculators and word processors may help school children cope with the symptoms of the disorder."
What is the outlook for Gerstmann's Syndrome ?,"In adults, many of the symptoms diminish over time. Although it has been suggested that in children symptoms may diminish over time, it appears likely that most children probably do not overcome their deficits, but learn to adjust to them."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Gerstmann's Syndrome ?,The NINDS supports research on disorders that result from damage to the brain such as dysgraphia. The NINDS and other components of the National Institutes of Health also support research on learning disabilities. Current research avenues focus on developing techniques to diagnose and treat learning disabilities and increase understanding of the biological basis of them.
What are the treatments for Whiplash ?,"Treatment for individuals with whiplash may include pain medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and a cervical collar (usually worn for 2 to 3 weeks). Range of motion exercises, physical therapy, and cervical traction may also be prescribed. Supplemental heat application may relieve muscle tension."
What is the outlook for Whiplash ?,"Generally, prognosis for individuals with whiplash is good. The neck and head pain clears within a few days or weeks. Most patients recover within 3 months after the injury, however, some may continue to have residual neck pain and headaches."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Whiplash ?,The NINDS conducts and supports research on trauma-related disorders such as whiplash. Much of this research focuses on increasing scientific understanding of these disorders and finding ways to prevent and treat them.
What is the outlook for Tardive Dyskinesia ?,"Symptoms of tardive dyskinesia may remain long after discontinuation of neuroleptic drugs. In many cases, the symptoms stop spontaneously, but in some cases they may persist indefinitely."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Tardive Dyskinesia ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports a broad range of research on movement disorders including tardive dyskinesia. The goals of this research are to improve understanding of these disorders and to discover ways to treat, prevent, and, ultimately, cure them."
What are the treatments for Isaacs' Syndrome ?,"Anticonvulsants, including phenytoin and carbamazepine, usually provide significant relief from the stiffness, muscle spasms, and pain associated with Isaacs' syndrome. Plasma exchange may provide short-term relief for individuals with some forms of the acquired disorder."
What is the outlook for Isaacs' Syndrome ?,There is no cure for Isaacs' syndrome. The long-term prognosis for individuals with the disorder is uncertain.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Isaacs' Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports an extensive research program of basic studies to increase understanding of diseases that affect the brain, spinal cord, muscles, and nerves. This research examines the genetics, symptoms, progression, and psychological and behavioral impact of diseases, with the goal of improving ways to diagnose, treat, and, ultimately, cure these disorders."
What is (are) Learning Disabilities ?,"Learning disabilities are disorders that affect the ability to understand or use spoken or written language, do mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention. Although learning disabilities occur in very young children, the disorders are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. Research shows that 8 to 10 percent of American children under 18 years of age have some type of learning disability."
What is the outlook for Learning Disabilities ?,"Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions. In some people, several overlapping learning disabilities may be apparent. Other people may have a single, isolated learning problem that has little impact on their lives."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Learning Disabilities ?,The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support research learning disabilities through grants to major research institutions across the country. Current research avenues focus on developing techniques to diagnose and treat learning disabilities and increase understanding of their biological basis.
What is the outlook for Spasticity ?,The prognosis for those with spasticity depends on the severity of the spasticity and the associated disorder(s).
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Spasticity ?,"The NINDS supports research on brain and spinal cord disorders that can cause spasticity. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding about these disorders and to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What are the treatments for Prosopagnosia ?,The focus of any treatment should be to help the individual with prosopagnosia develop compensatory strategies. Adults who have the condition as a result of stroke or brain trauma can be retrained to use other clues to identify individuals.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Prosopagnosia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to prosopagnosia in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as prosopagnosia."
What are the treatments for Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome ?,"Treatment for LNS is symptomatic. Gout can be treated with allopurinol to control excessive amounts of uric acid. Kidney stones may be treated with lithotripsy, a technique for breaking up kidney stones using shock waves or laser beams. There is no standard treatment for the neurological symptoms of LNS. Some may be relieved with the drugs carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol."
What is the outlook for Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome ?,The prognosis for individuals with LNS is poor. Death is usually due to renal failure in the first or second decade of life.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome ?,The gene associated with LNS is known. The NINDS supports and conducts research on genetic disorders such as LNS in an effort to find ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
What are the treatments for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome ?,"There is no cure for LEMS. Treatment is directed at decreasing the autoimmune response (through the use of steroids, plasmapheresis, or high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin) or improving the transmission of the disrupted electrical impulses by giving drugs such as di-amino pyridine or pyridostigmine bromide (Mestinon). For patients with small cell lung cancer, treatment of the cancer is the first priority."
What is the outlook for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome ?,The prognosis for individuals with LEMS varies. Those with LEMS not associated with malignancy have a benign overall prognosis. Generally the presence of cancer determines the prognosis.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports research on neuromuscular disorders such as LEMS with the ultimate goal of finding ways to treat, prevent, and cure them."
What are the treatments for Swallowing Disorders ?,"Changing a person's diet by adding thickeners helps many people, as does learning different ways to eat and chew that reduce the risk for aspiration. Occasionally drug therapy that helps the neurological disorder can also help dysphagia. In a few persons, botulinum toxin injections can help when food or liquid cannot enter the esophagus to get to the stomach. More severely disabled individuals may require surgery or the insertion of feeding tubes."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Swallowing Disorders ?,The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes at the National Institutes of Health conduct research related to dysphagia in their clinics and laboratories and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to treat dysphagia.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Post-Polio Syndrome ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to PPS in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional PPS research through grants to major medical institutions across the country."
What are the treatments for Absence of the Septum Pellucidum ?,Absence of the SP alone is not a disorder but is instead a characteristic noted in children with septo-optic dysplasia or other developmental anomalies.
What is the outlook for Absence of the Septum Pellucidum ?,"When the absence of the septum pellucidum is part of septo-optic dysplasia, the prognosis varies according to the presence and severity of associated symptoms. By itself, absence of the septum pellucidum is not life-threatening."
What is the outlook for Microcephaly ?,"Some children with microcephaly will have normal intelligence and a head that will grow bigger, but they may track below the normal growth curves for head circumference. Some children may have only mild disability, while those with more severe cases may face significant learning disabilities, cognitive delays, or develop other neurological disorders. Many, if not most, cases if Zika microcephaly will be very severe, possibly requiring lifelong intensive care."
What are the treatments for Erb-Duchenne and Dejerine-Klumpke Palsies ?,"Some brachial plexus injuries may heal without treatment. Many children who are injured during birth improve or recover by 3 to 4 months of age. Treatment for brachial plexus injuries includes physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery."
What is the outlook for Erb-Duchenne and Dejerine-Klumpke Palsies ?,"The site and type of brachial plexus injury determines the prognosis. For avulsion and rupture injuries, there is no potential for recovery unless surgical reconnection is made in a timely manner. The potential for recovery varies for neuroma and neuropraxia injuries. Most individuals with neuropraxia injuries recover spontaneously with a 90-100 percent return of function."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Erb-Duchenne and Dejerine-Klumpke Palsies ?,The NINDS conducts and supports research on injuries to the nervous system such as brachial plexus injuries. Much of this research is aimed at finding ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
What is the outlook for Dementia With Lewy Bodies ?,"Like Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease, DLB is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressive intellectual and functional deterioration. There are no known therapies to stop or slow the progression of DLB. Average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that in Alzheimers disease, about 8 years, with progressively increasing disability."
What are the treatments for Encephalitis Lethargica ?,Treatment for encephalitis lethargica is symptomatic. Levodopa and other antiparkinson drugs often produce dramatic responses.
What is the outlook for Encephalitis Lethargica ?,The course of encephalitis lethargica varies depending upon complications or accompanying disorders.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Encephalitis Lethargica ?,"The NINDS supports research on disorders that affect the brain, such as encephalitis lethargica, with the goal of finding ways to prevent and treat them. (The disease was the subject of the book and film, ""Awakenings."")"
What are the treatments for Cephalic Disorders ?,"Treatments for cephalic disorders depend upon the particular type of disorder. For most cephalic disorders, treatment is only symptomatic and supportive. In some cases, anticonvulsant medications shunts, or physical therapy are appropriate."
What is the outlook for Cephalic Disorders ?,"The degree to which damage to the developing nervous system harms the mind and body varies enormously. Many disabilities are mild enough to allow those afflicted to eventually function independently in society. Others are not. Some infants, children, and adults die; others remain totally disabled; and an even larger population is partially disabled, functioning well below normal capacity."
What are the treatments for Multi-Infarct Dementia ?,"There is no treatment available to reverse brain damage that has been caused by a stroke. Treatment focuses on preventing future strokes by controlling or avoiding the diseases and medical conditions that put people at high risk for stroke: high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease. The best treatment for MID is prevention early in life eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, moderately using alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight."
What is the outlook for Multi-Infarct Dementia ?,"The prognosis for individuals with MID is generally poor. The symptoms of the disorder may begin suddenly, often in a step-wise pattern after each small stroke. Some people with MID may even appear to improve for short periods of time, then decline after having more silent strokes. The disorder generally takes a downward course with intermittent periods of rapid deterioration. Death may occur from stroke, heart disease, pneumonia, or other infection."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Multi-Infarct Dementia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to MID in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure the vascular dementias, such as MID."
What are the treatments for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus ?,Treatment for NPH involves surgical placement of a shunt in the brain to drain excess CSF into the abdomen where it can be absorbed as part of the normal circulatory process. This allows the brain ventricles to return to their normal size. Regular follow-up care by a physician is important in order to identify subtle changes that might indicate problems with the shunt.
What is the outlook for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus ?,"The symptoms of NPH usually get worse over time if the condition is not treated, although some people may experience temporary improvements. While the success of treatment with shunts varies from person to person, some people recover almost completely after treatment and have a good quality of life. Early diagnosis and treatment improves the chance of a good recovery. Without treatment, symptoms may worsen and cause death."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports research on neurological disorders, including normal pressure hydrocephalus. Research on disorders such as normal pressure hydrocephalus focuses on increasing knowledge and understanding of the disorder, improving diagnostic techniques and neuroimaging, and finding improved treatments and preventions."
What are the treatments for Miller Fisher Syndrome ?,Treatment for Miller Fisher syndrome is identical to treatment for Guillain-Barr syndrome: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasmapheresis (a procedure in which antibodies are removed from the blood) and supportive care.
What is the outlook for Miller Fisher Syndrome ?,"The prognosis for most individuals with Miller Fisher syndrome is good. In most cases, recovery begins within 2 to 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms, and may be almost complete within 6 months. Some individuals are left with residual deficits. Relapses may occur rarely (in less than 3 percent of cases)."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Miller Fisher Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports research aimed at discovering new ways to diagnose, treat, and, ultimately, cure neuropathies such as Miller Fisher syndrome."
What are the treatments for Chronic Pain ?,"Medications, acupuncture, local electrical stimulation, and brain stimulation, as well as surgery, are some treatments for chronic pain. Some physicians use placebos, which in some cases has resulted in a lessening or elimination of pain. Psychotherapy, relaxation and medication therapies, biofeedback, and behavior modification may also be employed to treat chronic pain."
What is the outlook for Chronic Pain ?,Many people with chronic pain can be helped if they understand all the causes of pain and the many and varied steps that can be taken to undo what chronic pain has done. Scientists believe that advances in neuroscience will lead to more and better treatments for chronic pain in the years to come.
What is the outlook for Adrenoleukodystrophy ?,Prognosis for patients with childhood cerebral X-ALD is generally poor due to progressive neurological deterioration unless bone marrow transplantation is performed early. Death usually occurs within 1 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms. Adult-onset AMN will progress over decades.
What are the treatments for Hydromyelia ?,"Generally, physicians recommend surgery for children with hydromyelia if they have moderate or severe neurological deficits. Surgical treatment re-establishes the normal flow of spinal fluid."
What is the outlook for Hydromyelia ?,"Surgery may permanently or temporarily relieve symptoms, but it can also cause a number of severe complications. In rare cases, hydromyelia may resolve on its own without any medical intervention."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hydromyelia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to hydromyelia in its clinics and laboratories at The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and supports additional research through grants to major research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure abnormalities of the spinal cord such as hydromyelia."
What are the treatments for Joubert Syndrome ?,"Treatment for Joubert syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. Infant stimulation and physical, occupational, and speech therapy may benefit some children. Infants with abnormal breathing patterns should be monitored. Screening for progressive eye, liver, and kidney complications associated with Joubert-related disorders should be performed on a regular basis."
What is the outlook for Joubert Syndrome ?,"The prognosis for infants with Joubert syndrome depends on whether or not the cerebellar vermis is partially developed or entirely absent, as well as on the extent and severity of other organ involvement, such as the kidneys and liver. Some children have a mild form of the disorder, with minimal motor disability and good mental development, while others may have severe motor disability, moderate impaired mental development, and multi-organ impairments."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Joubert Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports research on the development of the nervous system and the cerebellum. This research is critical for increasing our understanding of Joubert syndrome, and for developing methods of treatment and prevention.

On the other end of the disease spectrum, individuals with the mild form, in which spastic paraplegia is the chief symptom, may have nearly normal activity and life span."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease ?,"NINDS supports research on gene-linked disorders, including the leukodystrophies. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure them."
What is the outlook for Barth Syndrome ?,"Early and accurate diagnosis is key to prolonged survival for boys born with Barth syndrome. The disorder was once considered uniformly fatal in infancy, but some individuals are now living much longer. Severe infections and cardiac failure are common causes of death in affected children."
What are the treatments for Pervasive Developmental Disorders ?,There is no known cure for PDD. Medications are used to address specific behavioral problems; therapy for children with PDD should be specialized according to need. Some children with PDD benefit from specialized classrooms in which the class size is small and instruction is given on a one-to-one basis. Others function well in standard special education classes or regular classes with additional support.
What is the outlook for Pervasive Developmental Disorders ?,Early intervention including appropriate and specialized educational programs and support services plays a critical role in improving the outcome of individuals with PDD. PDD is not fatal and does not affect normal life expectancy.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Pervasive Developmental Disorders ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports research on developmental disabilities, including PDD. Much of this research focuses on understanding the neurological basis of PDD and on developing techniques to diagnose, treat, prevent, and ultimately cure this and similar disorders."
What are the treatments for Krabbe Disease ?,"There is no cure for Krabbe disease. Results of a very small clinical trial of children with infantile Krabbe disease found that children who received umbilical cord blood stem cells from unrelated donors prior to symptom onset developed with little neurological impairment. Bone marrow transplantation may help some people. Generally, treatment for the disorder is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help maintain or increase muscle tone and circulation."
What is the outlook for Krabbe Disease ?,Krabbe disease in infants is generally fatal before age 2. Individuals with a later onset form of the disease generally have a milder course of the disease and live significantly longer.
What are the treatments for Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) ?,"Treatment for CIDP includes corticosteroids such as prednisone, which may be prescribed alone or in combination with immunosuppressant drugs. Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy are effective. IVIg may be used even as a first-line therapy. Physiotherapy may improve muscle strength, function and mobility, and minimize the shrinkage of muscles and tendons and distortions of the joints."
What is the outlook for Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) ?,"The course of CIDP varies widely among individuals. Some may have a bout of CIDP followed by spontaneous recovery, while others may have many bouts with partial recovery in between relapses. The disease is a treatable cause of acquired neuropathy and initiation of early treatment to prevent loss of nerve axons is recommended. However, some individuals are left with some residual numbness or weakness."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) ?,"The NINDS supports a broad program of research on disorders of the nervous system, including CIDP. Much of this research is aimed at increasing the understanding of these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What is the outlook for Asperger Syndrome ?,"With effective treatment, children with AS can learn to cope with their disabilities, but they may still find social situations and personal relationships challenging. Many adults with AS are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs, although they may continue to need encouragement and moral support to maintain an independent life."
What are the treatments for Corticobasal Degeneration ?,"There is no treatment available to slow the course of corticobasal degeneration, and the symptoms of the disease are generally resistant to therapy. Drugs used to treat Parkinson disease-type symptoms do not produce any significant or sustained improvement. Clonazepam may help the myoclonus. Occupational, physical, and speech therapy can help in managing disability."
What is the outlook for Corticobasal Degeneration ?,Corticobasal degeneration usually progresses slowly over the course of 6 to 8 years. Death is generally caused by pneumonia or other complications of severe debility such as sepsis or pulmonary embolism.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Corticobasal Degeneration ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research studies on degenerative disorders such as corticobasal degeneration. The goals of these studies are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Periventricular Leukomalacia ?,The NINDS supports and conducts research on brain injuries such as PVL. Much of this research is aimed at finding ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
What is (are) Brown-Sequard Syndrome ?,"Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS) is a rare neurological condition characterized by a lesion in the spinal cord which results in weakness or paralysis (hemiparaplegia) on one side of the body and a loss of sensation (hemianesthesia) on the opposite side. BSS may be caused by a spinal cord tumor, trauma (such as a puncture wound to the neck or back), ischemia (obstruction of a blood vessel), or infectious or inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis."
What are the treatments for Brown-Sequard Syndrome ?,Generally treatment for individuals with BSS focuses on the underlying cause of the disorder. Early treatment with high-dose steroids may be beneficial in many cases. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
What is the outlook for Brown-Sequard Syndrome ?,The prognosis for individuals with BSS varies depending on the cause of the disorder.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Brown-Sequard Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts a wide range of research on spinal cord disorders such as BSS. The goal of this research is to find ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure these disorders."
What are the treatments for Neurological Sequelae Of Lupus ?,"There is no cure for lupus. Treatment is symptomatic. With a combination of medication, rest, exercise, proper nutrition, and stress management, most individuals with lupus can often achieve remission or reduce their symptom levels. Medications used in the treatment of lupus may include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, antimalarials, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs."
What is the outlook for Neurological Sequelae Of Lupus ?,"The prognosis for lupus varies widely depending on the organs involved and the intensity of the inflammatory reaction. The course of lupus is commonly chronic and relapsing, often with long periods of remission. Most individuals with lupus do not develop serious health problems and have a normal lifespan with periodic doctor visits and treatments with various drugs."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Neurological Sequelae Of Lupus ?,"Investigators researching lupus seek to increase scientific understanding of the disorder and to find ways to treat, prevent, and ultimately, cure it. Several components of the National Institutes of Health support research on lupus."
What are the treatments for Generalized Gangliosidoses ?,No specific treatment exists for the gangliosidoses. Anticonvulsants may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and keeping the airway open.
What is the outlook for Generalized Gangliosidoses ?,Children with early infantile GM1 often die by age 3 from cardiac complications or pneumonia. Children with the early-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease may eventually need a feeding tube and often die by age 4 from recurring infection. Children with Sandhoff disease generally die by age 3 from respiratory infections.
What are the treatments for Paroxysmal Hemicrania ?,"The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin often provides complete relief from symptoms. Other less effective NSAIDs, calcium-channel blocking drugs (such as verapamil), and corticosteroids may be used to treat the disorder. Patients with both paroxysmal hemicrania and trigeminal neuralgia (a condition of the 5th cranial nerve that causes sudden, severe pain typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek) should receive treatment for each disorder."
What is the outlook for Paroxysmal Hemicrania ?,Many patients experience complete to near-complete relief of symptoms following physician-supervised medical treatment. Paroxysmal hemicrania may last indefinitely but has been known to go into remission or stop spontaneously.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Paroxysmal Hemicrania ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support research related to paroxysmal hemicrania through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure headache disorders such as paroxysmal hemicrania."
What are the treatments for Myopathy ?,"Treatments for the myopathies depend on the disease or condition and specific causes.

Some kinds of tumors may recur."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Cushing's Syndrome ?,"NINDS supports research on Cushing's syndrome aimed at finding new ways to diagnose, treat, and cure the disorder."
What are the treatments for Moyamoya Disease ?,"There are several types of surgery that can restore blood flow (revascularization) to the brain by opening narrowed blood vessels or by bypassing blocked arteries. Children usually respond better to revascularization surgery than adults, but the majority of individuals have no further strokes or related problems after surgery."
What is the outlook for Moyamoya Disease ?,"Without surgery, the majority of individuals with Moyamoya disease will experience mental decline and multiple strokes because of the progressive narrowing of arteries.Without treatment,Moyamoya diseasecan be fatal as the result ofintracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain)."
What is the outlook for Pituitary Tumors ?,"If diagnosed early enough, the prognosis is usually excellent. If diagnosis is delayed, even a non-functioning tumor can cause problems if it grows large enough to press on the optic nerves, the brain, or the carotid arteries (the vessels that bring blood to the brain). Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to a good prognosis."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Pituitary Tumors ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to brain tumors, including pituitary tumors, in their laboratories at the NIH and also support research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure pituitary tumors."
What is the outlook for Foot Drop ?,"The prognosis for foot drop depends on the cause. Foot drop caused by trauma or nerve damage usually shows partial or even complete recovery.

Some cases may be mild and progress very slowly over a normal lifespan, while others produce severe muscle weakness, functional disability, and loss of the ability to walk. Some children with MD die in infancy while others live into adulthood with only moderate disability."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Muscular Dystrophy ?,"The NINDS supports a broad program of research studies on MD. The goals of these studies are to understand MD and to develop techniques to diagnose, treat, prevent, and ultimately cure the disorder. The NINDS is a member of the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee (MDCC). For additional information, please visit: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/about_ninds/groups/mdcc/"
What are the treatments for Tourette Syndrome ?,"Because tic symptoms do not often cause impairment, the majority of people with TS require no medication for tic suppression. However, effective medications are available for those whose symptoms interfere with functioning. There is no one medication that is helpful to all people with TS, nor does any medication completely eliminate symptoms. Effective medications are also available to treat some of the associated neurobehavioral disorders that can occur in patients with TS."
What is the outlook for Tourette Syndrome ?,"Although TS can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood. As a result, some individuals may actually become symptom free or no longer need medication for tic suppression."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hypertonia ?,NINDS supports research on brain and spinal cord disorders that can cause hypertonia. The goals of this research are to learn more about how the nervous system adapts after injury or disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
What are the treatments for Friedreich's Ataxia ?,"There is currently no effective cure or treatment for Friedreich's ataxia. However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated to help individuals maintain optimal functioning as long as possible. Diabetes and heart problems can be treated with medications. Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be treated with braces or surgery. Physical therapy may prolong use of the arms and legs."
What is the outlook for Friedreich's Ataxia ?,"Generally, within 15 to 20 years after the appearance of the first symptoms, the person is confined to a wheelchair, and in later stages of the disease, individuals may become completely incapacitated. Friedreich's ataxia can shorten life expectancy; heart disease is the most common cause of death. Many individuals with Friedreich's ataxia die in early adulthood, but some people with less severe symptoms live into their 60s, 70s, or longer."
What is the outlook for Wilson Disease ?,"Early onset of the disease may foretell a worse prognosis than later onset. If the disorder is detected early and treated appropriately, an individual with WD can usually enjoy normal health and a normal lifespan. If not treated, however, WD can cause brain damage, liver failure, and death. The disease requires lifelong treatment."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Wilson Disease ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and/or support research related to Wilson disease. Growing knowledge of the copper transporting gene ATP7B, which in its mutated form causes WD, should lead to the design of better therapies for this disorder."
What are the treatments for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease ?,"There is no cure for CMT, but physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces and other orthopedic devices, and orthopedic surgery can help people cope with the disabling symptoms of the disease. In addition, pain-killing drugs can be prescribed for patients who have severe pain."
What are the treatments for Alternating Hemiplegia ?,Drug therapy including verapamil may help to reduce the severity and duration of attacks of paralysis associated with the more serious form of alternating hemiplegia
What is the outlook for Alternating Hemiplegia ?,"Children with the benign form of alternating hemiplegia have a good prognosis. Those who experience the more severe form have a poor prognosis because intellectual and mental capacities do not respond to drug therapy, and balance and gait problems continue. Over time, walking unassisted becomes difficult or impossible."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Alternating Hemiplegia ?,"The NINDS supports research on paralytic disorders such as alternating hemiplegia, with the goals of learning more about these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat and, ultimately cure them."
What is (are) Meralgia Paresthetica ?,"Meralgia paresthetica is a disorder characterized by tingling, numbness, and burning pain in the outer side of the thigh. The disorder is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, a sensory nerve to the skin, as it exits the pelvis. People with the disorder often notice a patch of skin that is sensitive to touch and sometimes painful. Meralgia paresthetica should not be associated with weakness or radiating pain from the back."
What are the treatments for Meralgia Paresthetica ?,"Treatment for meralgia paresthetica is symptomatic and supportive. The majority of cases improve with conservative treatment by wearing looser clothing and losing weight. Medications used to treat neurogenic pain, such as anti-seizure or anti-depressant medications, may alleviate symptoms of pain. In a few cases, in which pain is persistent or severe, surgical intervention may be indicated."
What is the outlook for Meralgia Paresthetica ?,"Meralgia paresthetica usually has a good prognosis. In most cases, meralgia paresthetica will improve with conservative treatment or may even spontaneously resolve. Surgical intervention is not always fully successful."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Meralgia Paresthetica ?,"Within the NINDS research programs, meralgia paresthetica is addressed primarily through studies associated with pain research.

The goals of this research are to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure these kinds of disorders."
What are the treatments for Encephalopathy ?,"Treatment is symptomatic and varies, according to the type and severity of the encephalopathy. Your physician can provide specific instructions for proper care and treatment. Anticonvulsants may be prescribed to reduce or halt any seizures. Changes to diet and nutritional supplements may help some patients. In severe cases, dialysis or organ replacement surgery may be needed."
What is the outlook for Encephalopathy ?,"Treating the underlying cause of the disorder may improve symptoms. However, the encephalopathy may cause permanent structural changes and irreversible damage to the brain. Some encephalopathies can be fatal."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Encephalopathy ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on brain diseases. Much of this research is aimed at characterizing the agents that cause these disorders, clarifying the mechanisms underlying them, and, ultimately, finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What is the outlook for Sturge-Weber Syndrome ?,"Although it is possible for the birthmark and atrophy in the cerebral cortex to be present without symptoms, most infants will develop convulsive seizures during their first year of life. There is a greater likelihood of intellectual impairment when seizures start before the age of 2 and are resistant to treatment. Prognosis is worst in the minority of children who have both sides of the brain affected by the blood vessel abnormalities."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Sturge-Weber Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports a broad program of research to better understand congenital seizure disorders. This research is aimed at developing techniques to diagnose, treat, prevent, and ultimately cure disorders such as Sturge-Weber syndrome."
What are the treatments for Kennedy's Disease ?,Currently there is no known cure for Kennedy's disease. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy and rehabilitation to slow muscle weakness and atrophy may prove helpful.
What is the outlook for Kennedy's Disease ?,"Kennedy's disease is slowly progressive. Individuals tend to remain ambulatory until late in the disease, although some may be wheelchair-bound during later stages. The life span of individuals with Kennedy's disease is usually normal."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Kennedy's Disease ?,"The NINDS supports a broad spectrum of research on motor neuron diseases, such as Kennedy's disease. Much of this research is aimed at increasing scientific understanding of these diseases and, ultimately, finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What is the outlook for Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome Disorder ?,"The prognosis depends upon the severity of symptoms. Children with early-onset AGS have the highest risk of death. Children with the later-onset form may be left with weakness or stiffness in the peripheral muscles and arms, weak muscles in the trunk of the body, and poor head control. Almost all children with AGS have mild to severe intellectual and physical impairment."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome Disorder ?,The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support research related to AGS through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Current research is aimed at finding new methods for treating and ultimately preventing or curing AGS.
What is (are) Pseudotumor Cerebri ?,"Pseudotumor cerebri literally means ""false brain tumor."" It is likely due to high pressure within the skull caused by the buildup or poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The disorder is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 50. Symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri, which include headache, nausea, vomiting, and pulsating sounds within the head, closely mimic symptoms of large brain tumors."
What is the outlook for Pseudotumor Cerebri ?,"The disorder may cause progressive, permanent visual loss in some patients. In some cases, pseudotumor cerebri recurs."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Pseudotumor Cerebri ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports research on disorders of the brain and nervous system, including pseudotumor cerebri. This research focuses primarily on increasing scientific understanding of these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What is (are) Schilder's Disease ?,"Schilder's disease is a rare progressive demyelinating disorder which usually begins in childhood. Schilder's disease is not the same as Addison-Schilder disease (adrenoleukodystrophy). Symptoms may include dementia, aphasia, seizures, personality changes, poor attention, tremors, balance instability, incontinence, muscle weakness, headache, vomiting, and vision and speech impairment. The disorder is a variant of multiple sclerosis."
What are the treatments for Schilder's Disease ?,"Treatment for the disorder follows the established standards in multiple sclerosis and includes corticosteroids, beta-interferon or immunosuppressive therapy, and symptomatic treatment."
What is the outlook for Schilder's Disease ?,"As with multiple sclerosis, the course and prognosis of Schilder's disease are unpredictable. For some individuals the disorder is progressive with a steady, unremitting course. Others may experience significant improvement and even remission. In some cases, Schilder's disease is fatal."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Schilder's Disease ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts an extensive research program on demyelinating disorders such as Schilder's disease. Much of this research focuses on learning more about these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What is the outlook for Tarlov Cysts ?,"In some instances Tarlov cysts can cause nerve pain and other pain, weakness, or nerve root compression. Acute and chronic pain may require changes in lifestyle. If left untreated, nerve root compression can cause permanent neurological damage."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Tarlov Cysts ?,"The NINDS, a component of the National Institutes of Health within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments to reduce and prevent pain and nerve damage."

What is the outlook for Neuroacanthocytosis ?,"Neuroacanthocytosis is a progressive disease, and in some cases may be complicated by poor nutritional status, cardiac abnormalities, and pneumonia."
What are the treatments for Sotos Syndrome ?,There is no standard course of treatment for Sotos syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic.
What is the outlook for Sotos Syndrome ?,"Sotos syndrome is not a life-threatening disorder and patients may have a normal life expectancy. The initial abnormalities of Sotos syndrome usually resolve as the growth rate becomes normal after the first few years of life. Developmental delays may improve in the school-age years, and adults with Sotos syndrome are likely to be within the normal range for intellect and height. However, coordination problems may persist into adulthood."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Sotos Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts a wide range of studies which focus on identifying and learning more about the genes involved in normal brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and, thus, may eventually give clues to understanding disorders such as Sotos syndrome."
What are the treatments for Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal Syndrome (COFS) ?,"Treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Individuals with the disorder often require tube feeding. Because COFS is genetic, genetic counseling is available."
What is the outlook for Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal Syndrome (COFS) ?,COFS is a fatal disease. Most children do not live beyond five years.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal Syndrome (COFS) ?,"The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders such as COFS. The goals of this research include finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders."
What is (are) Piriformis Syndrome ?,"Piriformis syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder that occurs when the piriformis muscle compresses or irritates the sciatic nerve-the largest nerve in the body. The piriformis muscle is a narrow muscle located in the buttocks. Compression of the sciatic nerve causes pain-frequently described as tingling or numbness-in the buttocks and along the nerve, often down to the leg. The pain may worsen as a result of sitting for a long period of time, climbing stairs, walking, or running."
What are the treatments for Piriformis Syndrome ?,"Generally, treatment for the disorder begins with stretching exercises and massage. Anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed. Cessation of running, bicycling, or similar activities may be advised. A corticosteroid injection near where the piriformis muscle and the sciatic nerve meet may provide temporary relief. In some cases, surgery is recommended."
What is the outlook for Piriformis Syndrome ?,"The prognosis for most individuals with piriformis syndrome is good. Once symptoms of the disorder are addressed, individuals can usually resume their normal activities. In some cases, exercise regimens may need to be modified in order to reduce the likelihood of recurrence or worsening."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Piriformis Syndrome ?,"Within the NINDS research programs, piriformis syndrome is addressed primarily through studies associated with pain research. NINDS vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments for pain and nerve damage with the ultimate goal of reversing debilitating conditions such as piriformis syndrome."
What are the treatments for Spinal Cord Infarction ?,Treatment is symptomatic. Physical and occupational therapy may help individuals recover from weakness or paralysis. A catheter may be necessary for patients with urinary incontinence.
What is the outlook for Spinal Cord Infarction ?,Recovery depends upon how quickly treatment is received and how severely the body is compromised. Paralysis may persist for many weeks or be permanent. Most individuals have a good chance of recovery.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Spinal Cord Infarction ?,"NINDS conducts and supports research on disorders of the spinal cord such as spinal cord infarction, aimed at learning more about these disorders and finding ways to prevent and treat them."
What is the outlook for Repetitive Motion Disorders ?,"Most individuals with RMDs recover completely and can avoid re-injury by changing the way they perform repetitive movements, the frequency with which they perform them, and the amount of time they rest between movements. Without treatment, RMDs may result in permanent injury and complete loss of function in the affected area."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Repetitive Motion Disorders ?,Much of the on-going research on RMDs is aimed at prevention and rehabilitation. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) funds research on RMDs.
What are the treatments for Klippel Feil Syndrome ?,"Treatment for Klippel-Feil Syndrome is symptomatic and may include surgery to relieve cervical or craniocervical instability and constriction of the spinal cord, and to correct scoliosis. Physical therapy may also be useful."
What is the outlook for Klippel Feil Syndrome ?,The prognosis for most individuals with Klippel-Feil Syndrome is good if the disorder is treated early and appropriately. Activities that can injure the neck should be avoided.
What are the treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ?,"Initial treatment generally involves immobilizing the wrist in a splint, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to temporarily reduce swelling, and injections of corticosteroid drugs (such as prednisone). For more severe cases, surgery may be recommended."
What is the outlook for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ?,"In general, carpal tunnel syndrome responds well to treatment, but less than half of individuals report their hand(s) feeling completely normal following surgery. Some residual numbness or weakness is common. At work, people can perform stretching exercises, take frequent rest breaks, wear splints to keep wrists straight, and use correct posture and wrist position to help prevent or worsen symptoms. Wearing fingerless gloves can help keep hands warm and flexible."
What are the treatments for Opsoclonus Myoclonus ?,"Treatment for opsoclonus myoclonus may include corticosteroids or ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). In cases where there is a tumor present, treatment such as chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation may be required."
What is the outlook for Opsoclonus Myoclonus ?,"The prognosis for opsoclonus myoclonus varies depending on the symptoms and the presence and treatment of tumors. With treatment of the underlying cause of the disorder, there may be an improvement of symptoms. The symptoms sometimes recur without warning. Generally the disorder is not fatal."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Opsoclonus Myoclonus ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on movement disorders such as opsoclonus myoclonus. These studies are aimed at increasing knowledge about these disorders and finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What are the treatments for Dysautonomia ?,"There is usually no cure for dysautonomia. Secondary forms may improve with treatment of the underlying disease. In many cases treatment of primary dysautonomia is symptomatic and supportive. Measures to combat orthostatic hypotension include elevation of the head of the bed, water bolus (rapid infusion of water given intravenously), a high-salt diet, and drugs such as fludrocortisone and midodrine."
What is the outlook for Dysautonomia ?,"The outlook for individuals with dysautonomia depends on the particular diagnostic category. People with chronic, progressive, generalized dysautonomia in the setting of central nervous system degeneration have a generally poor long-term prognosis. Death can occur from pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Dysautonomia ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on dysautonomia. This research aims to discover ways to diagnose, treat, and, ultimately, prevent these disorders."
What are the treatments for Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ?,There is no cure for MLD. Bone marrow transplantation may delay progression of the disease in some infantile-onset cases. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Considerable progress has been made with regard to gene therapy in an animal model of MLD and in clinical trials.
What is the outlook for Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ?,The prognosis for MLD is poor. Most children within the infantile form die by age 5. Symptoms of the juvenile form progress with death occurring 10 to 20 years following onset. Those persons affected by the adult form typically die withing 6 to 14 years following onset of symptoms.
What are the treatments for Aicardi Syndrome ?,There is no cure for Aicardi syndrome nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment generally involves medical management of seizures and programs to help parents and children cope with developmental delays. Long-term management by a pediatric neurologist with expertise in the management of infantile spasms is recommended.
What is the outlook for Aicardi Syndrome ?,"The prognosis for girls with Aicardi syndrome varies according to the severity of their symptoms. There is an increased risk for death in childhood and adolescence, but survivors into adulthood have been described."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Aicardi Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on neurogenetic disorders such as Aicardi syndrome. The goals of this research are to locate and understand the genes involved and to develop techniques to diagnose, treat, prevent, and ultimately cure disorders such as Aicardi syndrome."
What are the treatments for Refsum Disease ?,"The primary treatment for ARD is to restrict or avoid foods that contain phytanic acid, including dairy products; beef and lamb; and fatty fish such as tuna, cod, and haddock. Some individuals may also require plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) in which blood is drawn, filtered, and reinfused back into the body, to control the buildup of phytanic acid."
What is the outlook for Refsum Disease ?,"ARD is treatable because phytanic acid is not produced by the body, but is only found in foods. With treatment, muscle weakness, numbness, and dry and scaly skin generally disappear. However, vision and hearing problems may persist and the sense of smell may not return. Untreated, ARD can lead to sudden death caused by heartbeat abnormalities."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Refsum Disease ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) supports research related to Adult Refsum Disease through grants to major research institutions across the country. Research is focused on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure ARD and other peroxisomal disorders."
What are the treatments for Frontotemporal Dementia ?,"No treatment has been shown to slow the progression of FTD. Behavior modification may help control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. Aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors could require medication. Anti-depressants have been shown to improve some symptoms."
What is the outlook for Frontotemporal Dementia ?,"The outcome for people with FTD is poor. The disease progresses steadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others. Eventually some individuals with FTD will need 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in an institutionalized care setting."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Frontotemporal Dementia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conduct research related to FTD in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country."
What are the treatments for Shaken Baby Syndrome ?,"Emergency treatment for a baby who has been shaken usually includes life-sustaining measures such as respiratory support and surgery to stop internal bleeding and bleeding in the brain. Doctors may use brain scans, such as MRI and CT, to make a more definite diagnosis."
What is the outlook for Shaken Baby Syndrome ?,"In comparison with accidental traumatic brain injury in infants, shaken baby injuries have a much worse prognosis. Damage to the retina of the eye can cause blindness. The majority of infants who survive severe shaking will have some form of neurological or mental disability, such as cerebral palsy or cognitive impairment, which may not be fully apparent before 6 years of age. Children with shaken baby syndrome may require lifelong medical care."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Shaken Baby Syndrome ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conduct research related to shaken baby syndrome in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to treat and heal medical conditions such as shaken baby syndrome."
What are the treatments for Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease ?,"There is no cure for GSS, nor are there any known treatments to slow progression of the disease. Current therapies are aimed at alleviating symptoms and making the patient as comfortable as possible."
What is the outlook for Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease ?,"GSS is a slowly progressive condition usually lasting from 2 to 10 years. The disease ultimately causes severe disability and finally death, often after the patient goes into a coma or has a secondary infection such as aspiration pneumonia due to an impaired ability to swallow."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on TSEs, including GSS. Much of this research is aimed at characterizing the agents that cause these disorders, clarifying the mechanisms underlying them, and, ultimately, finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What are the treatments for Dandy-Walker Syndrome ?,"Treatment for individuals with Dandy-Walker Syndrome generally consists of treating the associated problems, if needed. A surgical procedure called a shunt may be required to drain off excess fluid within the brain, which will reduce pressure inside the skull and improve symptoms. Treatment may also include various forms of therapy (physicial, occupational) and specialized education."
What is the outlook for Dandy-Walker Syndrome ?,"The effect of Dandy-Walker Syndrome on intellectual development is variable, with some children having normal cognition and others never achieving normal intellectual development even when the excess fluid buildup is treated early and correctly. Longevity depends on the severity of the syndrome and associated malformations. The presence of multiple congenital defects may shorten life span."
What is the outlook for Spina Bifida ?,"The prognosis for individuals with SB depends on the number and severity of abnormalities. Prognosis is poorest for those with complete paralysis, hydrocephalus, and other congenital defects. With proper care, most children with SB live well into adulthood."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Spina Bifida ?,"The NINDS supports a broad range of research on neural tube defects such as SB aimed at finding ways to treat, prevent, and, ultimately, cure these disorders. Recent studies have shown that the addition of folic acid to the diet of women of child-bearing age may significantly reduce the incidence of neural tube defects. Therefore it is recommended that all women of child-bearing age consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily."
What are the treatments for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ?,"Generally, intensive care is needed. The neuroleptic or antipsychotic drug is discontinued, and the fever is treated aggressively. A muscle relaxant may be prescribed. Dopaminergic drugs, such as a dopamine agonist, have been reported to be useful."
What is the outlook for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ?,"Early identification of and treatment for individuals with neuroleptic malignant syndrome improves outcome. If clinically indicated, a low potency neuroleptic can be reintroduced very slowly when the individual recovers, although there is a risk that the syndrome might recur. Another alternative is to substitute another class of drugs for the neuroleptic. Anesthesia may be a risk to individuals who have experienced neuroleptic malignant syndrome."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ?,The NINDS supports research on neurological disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Much of this research focuses on finding ways to prevent and treat the disorder.
What are the treatments for Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?,"The main goal of treatment is to thin the blood to reduce clotting. At present, the recommended treatment is low-dose aspirin. For individuals who have already had a stroke or experience recurrent clots, doctors recommend treatment with the anticoagulant warfarin. Pregnant women are treated with either aspirin or another anticoagulant -- heparin -- since warfarin can cause birth defects."
What is the outlook for Kearns-Sayre Syndrome ?,KSS is a slowly progressive disorder. The prognosis for individuals with KSS varies depending on the severity and the number of organs involved. Early diagnosis and periodic electrocardiogram (ECG) are important since heart block can cause death in 20 percent of patients. Early pacemaker implantation can be of great benefit and offer a longer life expectancy in many patients.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Kearns-Sayre Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports research on neuromuscular disorders such as KSS. The goals of this research are to increase understanding of these disorders, and to find ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure them. The most promising approach for treatment in the future will be to alter replication or destroy abnormal mitochondria."
What is (are) Restless Legs Syndrome ?,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable, and sometimes overwhelming, urge to move them for relief. Individuals affected with the disorder often describe the sensations as throbbing, polling, or creeping. The sensations range in severity from uncomfortable to irritating to painful."
What is the outlook for Restless Legs Syndrome ?,"RLS is generally a life-long condition for which there is no cure. Symptoms may gradually worsen with age. Nevertheless, current therapies can control the disorder, minimizing symptoms and increasing periods of restful sleep. In addition, some individuals have remissions, periods in which symptoms decrease or disappear for days, weeks, or months, although symptoms usually eventually reappear."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Restless Legs Syndrome ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support RLS research in laboratories at the NIH and at major medical institutions across the country. The goal of this research is to increase scientific understanding of RLS, find improved methods of diagnosing and treating the syndrome, and discover ways to prevent it."
What are the treatments for Infantile Refsum Disease ?,"The primary treatment for IRD is to avoid foods that contain phytanic acid, including dairy products; beef and lamb; and fatty fish such as tuna, cod, and haddock. Although this prevents the accumulation of phytanic acid, it does not address the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids, and the deficiency of bile acids and plasmalogens."
What is the outlook for Infantile Refsum Disease ?,"IRD is a fatal disease, but some children will survive into their teens and twenties, and possibly even beyond."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Infantile Refsum Disease ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to IRDin its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Research is focused on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as the PBDs."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Reye's Syndrome ?,"Much of the research on RS focuses on answering fundamental questions about the disorder such as how problems in the body's metabolism may trigger the nervous system damage characteristic of RS and what role aspirin plays in this life-threatening disorder. The ultimate goal of this research is to improve scientific understanding, diagnosis and medical treatment of RS."
What are the treatments for Cerebral Arteriosclerosis ?,"Treatment for cerebral arteriosclerosis can include medications or surgery. Physicians also may recommend treatments to help people control high blood pressure, quit cigarette smoking, and reduce cholesterol levels, all of which are risk factors for cerebral arteriosclerosis."
What is the outlook for Cerebral Arteriosclerosis ?,Cerebral arteriosclerosis can lead to life threatening health events such as ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. People who survive stroke may have long-term neurological and motor impairments.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Cerebral Arteriosclerosis ?,The NINDS supports an extensive research program on stroke and conditions that can lead to stroke. Much of this research is aimed at finding ways to prevent and treat conditions such as cerebral arteriosclerosis.
What are the treatments for Schizencephaly ?,"Treatment generally consists of physical therapy and drugs to prevent seizures. In cases that are complicated by hydrocephalus, a surgically implanted tube, called a shunt, is often used to divert fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed."
What is the outlook for Schizencephaly ?,The prognosis for individuals with schizencephaly varies depending on the size of the clefts and the extent of neurological disabilities.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Schizencephaly ?,The NINDS conducts and supports a wide range of studies that explore the mechanisms of normal brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how to prevent or treat developmental brain defects such as schizencephaly.
What is the outlook for Inflammatory Myopathies ?,"Most cases of dermatomyositis respond to therapy. The prognosis for polymyositis varies. Most individuals respond fairly well to therapy, but some people have a more severe disease that does not respond adequately to therapies and are left with significant disability. IBM is generally resistant to all therapies and its rate of progression appears to be unaffected by currently available treatments."
What are the treatments for Stiff-Person Syndrome ?,"People with SPS respond to high doses of diazepam and several anti-convulsants, gabapentin and tiagabine. A recent study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and stress in people with SPS."
What is the outlook for Stiff-Person Syndrome ?,"Treatment with IVIg, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and pain relievers will improve the symptoms of SPS, but will not cure the disorder. Most individuals with SPS have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe. With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Stiff-Person Syndrome ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to SPS in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. A study using the drug rituximab proved ineffective in treating individuals with the disorder. Current research is focused on understanding the cause of the disease and the role of the anti-GAD antibodies."
What are the treatments for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia ?,"There are no specific treatments to prevent, slow, or reverse HSP. Symptomatic treatments used for spasticity, such as muscle relaxants, are sometimes helpful. Regular physical therapy is important for muscle strength and to preserve range of motion."
What is the outlook for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia ?,The prognosis for individuals with HSP varies Some individuals are very disabled and others have only mild disability. The majority of individuals with uncomplicated HSP have a normal life expectancy.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia ?,"The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders such as HSP. More than 30 genes that are responsible for several forms of HSP have been identified, and many more will likely be identified in the future. These genes generally encode proteins that normally help maintain the function of axons in the spinal cord. Understanding how mutations of these genes cause HSP should lead to ways to prevent, treat, and cure HSP."
What are the treatments for Leukodystrophy ?,"Treatment for most of the leukodystrophies is symptomatic and supportive, and may include medications, physical, occupational, and speech therapies; and nutritional, educational, and recreational programs. Bone marrow transplantation is showing promise for a few of the leukodystrophies."
What is the outlook for Leukodystrophy ?,The prognosis for the leukodystrophies varies according to the specific type of leukodystrophy.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Leukodystrophy ?,"The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders, including the leukodystrophies. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders, and to find ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure them."
What are the treatments for Canavan Disease ?,"Canavan disease causes progressive brain atrophy. There is no cure, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive."
What is the outlook for Canavan Disease ?,"The prognosis for Canavan disease is poor. Death usually occurs before age 10, although some children may survive into their teens and twenties."
What are the treatments for Alexander Disease ?,"There is no cure for Alexander disease, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment of Alexander disease is symptomatic and supportive."
What is the outlook for Alexander Disease ?,"The prognosis for individuals with Alexander disease is generally poor. Most children with the infantile form do not survive past the age of 6. Juvenile and adult onset forms of the disorder have a slower, more lengthy course."
What is the outlook for Neurological Complications of AIDS ?,The overall prognosis for individuals with AIDS in recent years has improved significantly because of new drugs and treatments. AIDS clinicians often fail to recognize neurological complications of AIDS. Those who suspect they are having neurological complications should be sure to discuss these with their doctor.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Neurological Complications of AIDS ?,"Within the Federal government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), one part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), supports research on the neurological consequences of AIDS. The NINDS works closely with its sister agency, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which has primary responsibility for research related to HIV and AIDS."
What are the treatments for Tabes Dorsalis ?,"Penicillin, administered intravenously, is the treatment of choice. Associated pain can be treated with opiates, valproate, or carbamazepine. Patients may also require physical or rehabilitative therapy to deal with muscle wasting and weakness. Preventive treatment for those who come into sexual contact with an individual with tabes dorsalis is important."
What is the outlook for Tabes Dorsalis ?,"If left untreated, tabes dorsalis can lead to paralysis, dementia, and blindness. Existing nerve damage cannot be reversed."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Tabes Dorsalis ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on neurodegenerative disorders, such as tabes dorsalis, in an effort to find ways to prevent, treat, and, ultimately, cure these disorders."
What are the treatments for Herpes Zoster Oticus ?,"Some cases of herpes zoster oticus do not require treatment. When treatment is needed, medications such as antiviral drugs or corticosteroids may be prescribed. Vertigo may be treated with the drug diazepam"
What is the outlook for Herpes Zoster Oticus ?,"Generally, the prognosis of herpes zoster oticus is good. However, in some cases, hearing loss may be permanent. Vertigo may last for days or weeks. Facial paralysis may be temporary or permanent."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Herpes Zoster Oticus ?,The NINDS supports research on shingles and shingles-related conditions. Current studies focus on the relationship between the persistence of neurotropic viruses and development of neurological diseases including herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses.
What is the outlook for Hemicrania Continua ?,Individuals may obtain complete to near-complete relief of symptoms with proper medical attention and daily medication. Some people may not be able to tolerate long-term use of indomethacin and may have to rely on less effective NSAIDs.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hemicrania Continua ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support research related to hemicrania continua through grants to medical research institutions across the country.

What are the treatments for Paroxysmal Choreoathetosis ?,"Drug therapy, particularly carbamazepine, has been very successful in reducing or eliminating attacks of paroxysmal choreoathetosis. While carbamazepine is not effective in every case, other drugs have been substituted with good effect."
What is the outlook for Paroxysmal Choreoathetosis ?,"Generally, paroxysmal choreoathetosis lessens with age, and many adults have a complete remission. Because drug therapy is so effective, the prognosis for the disorder is good."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Paroxysmal Choreoathetosis ?,NINDS supports and conducts research on movement disorders such as paroxysmal choreoathetosis. Much of this research is aimed at finding ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
What are the treatments for Tropical Spastic Paraparesis ?,"There is no established treatment program for HAM/TSP. Corticosteroids may relieve some symptoms, but arent likely to change the course of the disorder. Clinical studies suggest that interferon alpha provides benefits over short periods and some aspects of disease activity may be improved favorably using interferon beta. Stiff and spastic muscles may be treated with lioresal or tizanidine. Urinary dysfunction may be treated with oxybutynin."
What is the outlook for Tropical Spastic Paraparesis ?,"HAM/TSP is a progressive disease, but it is rarely fatal. Most individuals live for several decades after the diagnosis. Their prognosis improves if they take steps to prevent urinary tract infection and skin sores, and if they participate in physical and occupational therapy programs."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Tropical Spastic Paraparesis ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to HAM/TSP in laboratories at the NIH, and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as HAM/TSP."
What is the outlook for Alpers' Disease ?,"The prognosis for individuals with Alpers' disease is poor. Those with the disease usually die within their first decade of life. Continuous, unrelenting seizures often lead to death. Liver failure and cardiorespiratory failure due to brain, spinal cord, and nerve involvement may also occur."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Alpers' Disease ?,"The NINDS supports research on gene-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alpers' disease. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders, and to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What is the outlook for Myasthenia Gravis ?,"With treatment, most individuals with myasthenia can significantly improve their muscle weakness. Some case of myasthenia gravis may go into remission temporarily, and muscle weakness may disappear so that medications can be discontinued. In a few cases, the severe weakness of myasthenia gravis may cause respiratory failure, which requires immediate emergency medical care."
What are the treatments for Spinal Muscular Atrophy ?,There is no cure for SMA. Treatment consists of managing the symptoms and preventing complications.
What are the treatments for Incontinentia Pigmenti ?,"The skin abnormalities of IP usually disappear by adolescence or adulthood without treatment. Diminished vision may be treated with corrective lenses, medication, or, in severe cases, surgery. A specialist may treat dental problems. Neurological symptoms such as seizures, muscle spasms, or mild paralysis may be controlled with medication and/or medical devices and with the advice of a neurologist."
What is the outlook for Incontinentia Pigmenti ?,"Although the skin abnormalities usually regress, and sometimes disappear completely, there may be residual neurological difficulties."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Incontinentia Pigmenti ?,"Researchers have begun to use genetic linkage studies to map the location of genes associated with the neurocutaneous disorders. Research supported by the NINDS includes studies to understand how the brain and nervous system normally develop and function and how they are affected by genetic mutations. These studies contribute to a greater understanding of gene-linked disorders such as IP, and have the potential to open promising new avenues of treatment."
What are the treatments for Landau-Kleffner Syndrome ?,"Treatment for LKS usually consists of medications, such as anticonvulsants and corticosteroids, and speech therapy, which should be started early. A controversial treatment option involves a surgical technique called multiple subpial transection in which the pathways of abnormal electrical brain activity are severed"
What is the outlook for Landau-Kleffner Syndrome ?,"The prognosis for children with LKS varies. Some affected children may have a permanent severe language disorder, while others may regain much of their language abilities (although it may take months or years). In some cases, remission and relapse may occur. The prognosis is improved when the onset of the disorder is after age 6 and when speech therapy is started early. Seizures generally disappear by adulthood."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Landau-Kleffner Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports broad and varied programs of research on epilepsy and developmental disorders. This research is aimed at discovering new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat epilepsy and developmental disorders and, ultimately, to find cures for them."
What are the treatments for Central Pain Syndrome ?,"Pain medications often provide some reduction of pain, but not complete relief of pain, for those affected by central pain syndrome. Tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline or anticonvulsants such as neurontin (gabapentin) can be useful. Lowering stress levels appears to reduce pain."
What is the outlook for Central Pain Syndrome ?,"Central pain syndrome is not a fatal disorder, but the syndrome causes disabling chronic pain and suffering among the majority of individuals who have it."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Central Pain Syndrome ?,The NINDS vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments for chronic pain and nervous system damage. The goals of this research are to develop ways to more effectively treat and potentially reverse debilitating conditions such as central pain syndrome.
What are the treatments for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ?,"Because there is no cure for CRPS, treatment is aimed at relieving painful symptoms. Doctors may prescribe topical analgesics, antidepressants, corticosteroids, and opioids to relieve pain. However, no single drug or combination of drugs has produced consistent long-lasting improvement in symptoms. Other treatments may include physical therapy, sympathetic nerve block, spinal cord stimulation, and intrathecal drug pumps to deliver opioids and local anesthetic agents via the spinal cord."
What is the outlook for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ?,"The prognosis for CRPS varies from person to person. Spontaneous remission from symptoms occurs in certain individuals. Others can have unremitting pain and crippling, irreversible changes in spite of treatment."
What are the treatments for Ataxia Telangiectasia ?,"There is no cure for A-T and, currently, no way to slow the progression of the disease. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Physical and occupational therapy help to maintain flexibility. Speech therapy is important, teaching children to control air flow to the vocal cords. Gamma-globulin injections may be useful if immunoglobulin levels are sufficiently reduced to weaken the immune system. High-dose vitamin regimens and antioxidants such as alpha lipoic acid also may also be used."
What is the outlook for Ataxia Telangiectasia ?,"Average lifespan has been improving for years, for unknown reasons, and varies with the severity of the underlying mutations, ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) protein levels, and residual ATM kinase activity. Some individuals with later onset of disease and slower progression survive into their 50s."
What are the treatments for Klver-Bucy Syndrome ?,"Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and may include drug therapy."
What is the outlook for Klver-Bucy Syndrome ?,"There is no cure for Klver-Bucy syndrome. The disorder is not life-threatening, but the patient can be difficult to manage. With treatment, symptoms may slowly decline."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Klver-Bucy Syndrome ?,NINDS supports and conducts research on neurobehavioral disorders such as Klver-Bucy syndrome. Much of the research focuses on learning more about these disorders and finding ways to prevent and treat them.
What are the treatments for Niemann-Pick Disease ?,There is currently no cure for Niemann-Pick disease. Treatment is supportive. Children usually die from infection or progressive neurological loss. There is currently no effective treatment for persons with type A. Bone marrow transplantation has been attempted in a few individuals with type B. The development of enzyme replacement and gene therapies might also be helpful for those with type B. restricting one's diet does not prevent the buildup of lipids in cells and tissues.
What is the outlook for Niemann-Pick Disease ?,"Infants with type A die in infancy. Children with Type B may live a comparatively long time, but may require supplemental oxygen because of lung impairment. The life expectancy of persons with type C varies: some individuals die in childhood while others who appear to be less severely affected can live into adulthood."
What are the treatments for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome ?,"Treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome includes clobazam and anti-epileptic medications such as valproate, lamotrigine, felbamate, or topiramate. There is usually no single antiepileptic medication that will control seizures. Children who improve initially may later show tolerance to a drug or have uncontrollable seizures."
What is the outlook for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome ?,"The prognosis for individuals with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome varies. There is no cure for the disorder. Complete recovery, including freedom from seizures and normal development, is very unusual."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports a broad program of basic and clinical research on epilepsy including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. These studies are aimed at finding the causes of these disorders, improving the diagnosis, and developing new medications and other therapies."
What are the treatments for Paresthesia ?,The appropriate treatment for paresthesia depends on accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause.
What is the outlook for Paresthesia ?,The prognosis for those with paresthesia depends on the severity of the sensations and the associated disorders.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Paresthesia ?,"The NINDS supports research on disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves that can cause paresthesia. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What are the treatments for Myoclonus ?,"Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. The drug of first choice is clonazepam, a type of tranquilizer. Many of the drugs used for myoclonus, such as barbiturates, phenytoin, and primidone, are also used to treat epilepsy. Sodium valproate is an alternative therapy for myoclonus and can be used either alone or in combination with clonazepam. Myoclonus may require the use of multiple drugs for effective treatment."
What is the outlook for Dermatomyositis ?,Most cases of dermatomyositis respond to therapy. The disease is usually more severe and resistant to therapy in individuals with cardiac or pulmonary problems.
What are the treatments for Agnosia ?,Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. The primary cause of the disorder should be determined in order to treat other problems that may contribute to or result in agnosia.
What is the outlook for Agnosia ?,Agnosia can compromise quality of life.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Agnosia ?,The NINDS supports research on disorders of the brain such as agnosia with the goal of finding ways to prevent or cure them.
What is the outlook for Rett Syndrome ?,"The course of Rett syndrome, including the age of onset and the severity of symptoms, varies from child to child. Despite the difficulties with symptoms, most individuals with Rett syndrome continue to live well into middle age and beyond. Because the disorder is rare, very little is known about long-term prognosis and life expectancy."
What are the treatments for Brachial Plexus Injuries ?,"Some brachial plexus injuries may heal without treatment. Many children who are injured during birth improve or recover by 3 to 4 months of age. Treatment for brachial plexus injuries includes physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery."
What is the outlook for Brachial Plexus Injuries ?,"The site and type of brachial plexus injury determines the prognosis. For avulsion and rupture injuries, there is no potential for recovery unless surgical reconnection is made in a timely manner. The potential for recovery varies for neuroma and neuropraxia injuries. Most individuals with neuropraxia injuries recover spontaneously with a 90-100% return of function."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Brachial Plexus Injuries ?,The NINDS conducts and supports research on injuries to the nervous system such as brachial plexus injuries. Much of this research is aimed at finding ways to prevent and treat these disorders.
What is the outlook for Dementia ?,"There are many disorders that can cause dementia. Some, such as Alzheimers disease or Huntingtons disease, lead to a progressive loss of mental functions. But other types of dementia can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. People with moderate or advanced dementia typically need round-the-clock care and supervision to prevent them from harming themselves or others. They also may need assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, and dressing."
What is the outlook for Motor Neuron Diseases ?,"Prognosis varies depending on the type of MND and the age of onset. Some MNDs, such as primary lateral sclerosis and Kennedy disease, are not fatal and progress slowly. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy may appear to be stable for long periods, but improvement should not be expected. Some MNDs, such as ALS and some forms of spinal muscular atrophy, are fatal."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hydrocephalus ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports a wide range of fundamental studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to protect, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as hydrocephalus."
What are the treatments for Encephaloceles ?,"Generally, surgery is performed during infancy to place the protruding tissues back into the skull, remove the sac, and correct the associated craniofacial abnormalities. Even large protrusions can often be removed without causing major functional disability. Hydrocephalus associated with encephaloceles may require surgical treatment with a shunt. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."
What is the outlook for Encephaloceles ?,"The prognosis for individuals with encephaloceles varies depending on the type of brain tissue involved, the location of the sacs, and the accompanying brain malformations."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Encephaloceles ?,The NINDS conducts and supports a wide range of studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and offers hope for new means to treat and prevent congenital brain disorders including neural tube defects such as encephaloceles.
What are the treatments for Apraxia ?,"Generally, treatment for individuals with apraxia includes physical, speech,or occupational therapy. If apraxia is a symptom of another disorder, the underlying disorder should be treated."
What is the outlook for Apraxia ?,The prognosis for individuals with apraxia varies and depends partly on the underlying cause. Some individuals improve significantly while others may show very little improvement.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Apraxia ?,"The NINDS supports research on movement disorders and conditions such as apraxia. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders, and to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What are the treatments for Paraneoplastic Syndromes ?,"When present, the tumor and cancer are treated first, followed by efforts to decrease the autoimmune response -- either through steroids such as cortisone or prednisone, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, or irradiation. Plasmapheresis, a process that cleanses antibodies from the blood, may ease symptoms in people with paraneoplastic disorders that affect the peripheral nervous system. Speech and physical therapy may help individuals regain some functions."
What is the outlook for Paraneoplastic Syndromes ?,"There are no cures for paraneoplastic syndromes. There are no available treatments to stop progressive neurological damage. Generally, the stage of cancer at diagnosis determines the outcome."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Paraneoplastic Syndromes ?,"Research on paraneoplastic syndromes is aimed at enhancing scientific understanding and evaluating new therapeutic interventions. Researchers seek to learn what causes the autoimmune response in these disorders. Studies are directed at developing tests that detect the presence of antibodies. Scientists also hope to develop animal models for these diseases, which may be used to determine effective treatment strategies."
What are the treatments for Megalencephaly ?,There is no standard treatment for megalencephaly. Treatment will depend upon the disorder with which the megalencephaly is associated and will address individual symptoms and disabilities.
What is the outlook for Megalencephaly ?,The prognosis for infants and children with megalencephaly depends upon the underlying cause and the associated neurological disorders. The prognosis for children with hemimegalencephaly is poor.
What is the outlook for Diabetic Neuropathy ?,"The prognosis for diabetic neuropathy depends largely on how well the underlying condition of diabetes is handled. Treating diabetes may halt progression and improve symptoms of the neuropathy, but recovery is slow. The painful sensations of diabetic neuropathy may become severe enough to cause depression in some patients."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Diabetic Neuropathy ?,The NINDS conducts and supports research on diabetic neuropathy to increase understanding of the disorder and find ways to prevent and cure it. New medications are currently being examined to assess improvement or stabilization of neuropathic symptoms.
What are the treatments for Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome ?,"Treatment involves replacement of thiamine and providing proper nutrition and hydration. In some cases, drug therapy is also recommended.Stopping alcohol use may prevent further nerve and brain damage. In individuals with Wernicke's encephalopathy, it is very important to start thiamine replacement before beginning nutritional replenishment."
What is the outlook for Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome ?,"Most symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy can be reversed if detected and treated promptly and completely. Stopping alcohol use may prevent further nerve and brain damage. However, improvement in memory function is slow and, usually, incomplete. Without treatment, these disorders can be disabling and life-threatening."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Cerebellar Degeneration ?,"The NINDS funds research to find the genes involved in diseases that cause cerebellar degeneration. Discovering these genes, identifying their mutations, and understanding how the abnormal proteins they produce cause cerebellar degeneration may eventually help scientists find ways to prevent, treat, and even cure the diseases that involve cerebellar degeneration."
What is the outlook for Parry-Romberg ?,"The prognosis for individuals with Parry-Romberg syndrome varies. In some cases, the atrophy ends before the entire face is affected. In mild cases, the disorder usually causes no disability other than cosmetic effects."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Parry-Romberg ?,"The NINDS supports research on neurological disorders such as Parry-Romberg syndrome with the goal of finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them."
What are the treatments for Myotonia Congenita ?,"Most people with myotonia congenita dont require special treatments. Stiff muscles usually resolve with exercise, or light movement, especially after resting. For individuals whose symptoms are more limiting, doctors have had some success with medications such as quinine, or anticonvulsant drugs such as phenytoin. Physical therapy and other rehabilitative therapies are also sometimes used to improve muscle function."
What is the outlook for Myotonia Congenita ?,"Most individuals with myotonia congenita lead long, productive lives. Although muscle stiffness may interfere with walking, grasping, chewing, and swallowing, it is usually relieved with exercise."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Myotonia Congenita ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to myotonia congenita and also supports additional research through grants to major research institutions across the country. Current research is exploring how, at the molecular level, the defective gene in myotonia congenita causes the specific symptoms of the disorder. Additional research is focused on developing animal models of the disorder to test potential treatments and therapies."
What are the treatments for Congenital Myopathy ?,"Currently, only central core disease has an effective treatment (see above). There are no known cures for any of these disorders. Supportive treatment may involve orthopedic treatments, as well as physical, occupational or speech therapy."
What is the outlook for Congenital Myopathy ?,"When breathing difficulties are severe, and particularly if there is also a problem with feeding and swallowing, infants may die of respiratory failure or complications such as pneumonia. Sometimes muscle weakness can lead to skeletal problems, such as scoliosis, reduced mobility of joints, or hip problems. The heart muscle is rarely involved."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Congenital Myopathy ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to congenital myopathies in their laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure the disorders that make up the congenital myopathies."
What is the outlook for Ataxia ?,The prognosis for individuals with ataxia and cerebellar/spinocerebellar degeneration varies depending on its underlying cause.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Ataxia ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts a broad range of basic and clinical research on cerebellar and spinocerebellar degeneration, including work aimed at finding the cause(s) of ataxias and ways to treat, cure, and, ultimately, prevent them. Scientists are optimistic that understanding the genetics of these disorders may lead to breakthroughs in treatment."
What are the treatments for Septo-Optic Dysplasia ?,"Treatment for SOD is symptomatic. Hormone deficiencies may be treated with hormone replacement therapy. The optical problems associated with SOD are generally not treatable. Vision, physical, and occupational therapies may be required."
What is the outlook for Septo-Optic Dysplasia ?,The prognosis for individuals with SOD varies according to the presence and severity of symptoms.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Septo-Optic Dysplasia ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts neurogenetic research which focuses on identifying and studying the genes involved in normal brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and, thus, may eventually give clues to understanding disorders such as SOD."

what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Coffin Lowry Syndrome ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on genetic disorders, such as Coffin-Lowry syndrome, in an effort to find ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure these disorders."
What are the treatments for Lipoid Proteinosis ?,"There is no cure for LP. Some doctors have had success treating the skin eruptions with oral steroid drugs and oral dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Carbon dioxide laser surgery of thickened vocal cords and eyelid bumps has proved helpful in some studies. Dermabrasion may improve the appearance of the skin lesions. Seizures, if present, may be treated with anticonvulsants."
What is the outlook for Lipoid Proteinosis ?,"Lipoid proteinosis has a stable or slowly progressive course. Children with LP may have behavioral or learning difficulties, along with seizures. Obstruction in the throat may require a tracheostomy. Mortality rates in infants and adults are slightly increased because of problems with throat obstructions and upper respiratory tract infections."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Lipoid Proteinosis ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conduct research related to neurological diseases such as lipoid proteinosis in laboratories at the NIH, and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as lipoid proteinosis."
What is the outlook for Kleine-Levin Syndrome ?,Episodes eventually decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of eight to 12 years.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Kleine-Levin Syndrome ?,NINDS supports a broad range of clinical and basic research on diseases causing sleep disorders in an effort to clarify the mechanisms of these conditions and to develop better treatments for them.
What are the treatments for Vasculitis Syndromes of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems ?,"Treatment for a vasculitis syndrome depends upon the specific diagnosis, which can be difficult, as some diseases have similar symptoms of vasculitis. Most of the syndromes respond well to steroid drugs, such as prednisolone. Some may also require treatment with an immunosuppressive drug, such as cyclophosphamide. Aneurysms involved with vasculitis can be treated surgfically."
What is the outlook for Vasculitis Syndromes of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems ?,"The prognosis is dependent upon the specific syndrome, however, some of the syndromes are fatal if left untreated."
What are the treatments for Menkes Disease ?,Treatment with daily copper injections may improve the outcome in Menkes disease if it begins within days after birth. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
What is the outlook for Menkes Disease ?,"Since newborn screening for this disorder is not available, and early detection is infrequent because the clinical signs of Menkes disease are subtle in the beginning, the disease is rarely treated early enough to make a significant difference. The prognosis for babies with Menkes disease is poor. Most children with Menkes disease die within the first decade of life."
What are the treatments for Brain and Spinal Tumors ?,"The three most commonly used treatments are surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Doctors also may prescribe steroids to reduce the tumor-related swelling inside the CNS."
What is the outlook for Brain and Spinal Tumors ?,"Symptoms of brain and spinal cord tumors generally develop slowly and worsen over time unless they are treated. The tumor may be classified as benign or malignant and given a numbered score that reflects its rate of malignancy. This score can help doctors determine how to treat the tumor and predict the likely outcome, or prognosis, for the individual."
What are the treatments for Hypersomnia ?,"Treatment is symptomatic in nature. Stimulants, such as amphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil, may be prescribed. Other drugs used to treat hypersomnia include clonidine, levodopa, bromocriptine, antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Changes in behavior (for example avoiding night work and social activities that delay bed time) and diet may offer some relief. Patients should avoid alcohol and caffeine."
What is the outlook for Hypersomnia ?,"The prognosis for persons with hypersomnia depends on the cause of the disorder. While the disorder itself is not life threatening, it can have serious consequences, such as automobile accidents caused by falling asleep while driving. The attacks usually continue indefinitely."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hypersomnia ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts research on sleep disorders such as hypersomnia. The goal of this research is to increase scientific understanding of the condition, find improved methods of diagnosing and treating it, and discover ways to prevent it."
What is the outlook for CADASIL ?,"Symptoms usually progress slowly. By age 65, the majority of persons with CADASIL have cognitive problems and dementia. Some will become dependent due to multiple strokes."
What are the treatments for Cerebral Hypoxia ?,"Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the hypoxia, but basic life-support systems have to be put in place: mechanical ventilation to secure the airway; fluids, blood products, or medications to support blood pressure and heart rate; and medications to suppress seizures."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Cerebral Hypoxia ?,"The NINDS supports and conducts studies aimed at understanding neurological conditions that can damage the brain, such as cerebral hypoxia. The goals of these studies are to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Cerebral Atrophy ?,"The NINDS funds research looking at many of the diseases and disorders that cause cerebral atrophy. Understanding the biological mechanisms that cause neurons to die in the brain will help researchers find ways to prevent, treat, and even cure the diseases that lead to cerebral atrophy."
What are the treatments for Pinched Nerve ?,"The most frequently recommended treatment for pinched nerve is rest for the affected area. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids may be recommended to help alleviate pain. Physical therapy is often useful, and splints or collars may be used to relieve symptoms. Depending on the cause and severity of the pinched nerve, surgery may be needed."
What is the outlook for Pinched Nerve ?,"With treatment, most people recover from pinched nerve. However, in some cases, the damage is irreversible."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Pinched Nerve ?,"Within the NINDS research programs, pinched nerves are addressed primarily through studies associated with pain research. NINDS vigorously pursues a research program seeking new treatments for pain and nerve damage with the ultimate goal of reversing debilitating conditions such as pinched nerves."
What is the outlook for Fabry Disease ?,"Individuals with Fabry disease often die prematurely of complications from strokes, heart disease, or kidney failure."
What is the outlook for Iniencephaly ?,The prognosis for infants with iniencephaly is extremely poor. Newborns seldom survive much past childbirth. The distortions of the babys body also pose a danger to the mother's life during delivery.
What are the treatments for Developmental Dyspraxia ?,"Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include occupational and speech therapy, and ""cueing"" or other forms of communication such as using pictures and hand gestures. Many children with the disorder require special education."
What is the outlook for Developmental Dyspraxia ?,Developmental dyspraxia is a lifelong disorder. Many individuals are able to compensate for their disabilities through occupational and speech therapy.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Developmental Dyspraxia ?,"The NINDS supports research on developmental disorders, such as developmental dyspraxia, aimed at learning more about these disorders, and finding ways to prevent and treat them."
What is the outlook for Fibromuscular Dysplasia ?,"Currently there is no cure for FMD. Medicines and angioplasty can reduce the risk of initial or recurrent stroke. In rare cases, FMD-related aneurysms can burst and bleed into the brain, causing stroke, permanent nerve damage, or death."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Fibromuscular Dysplasia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the nations primary funding source for research on the brain and nervous system. The NINDS conducts research on stroke and vascular lesions of the nervous system and supports studies through grants to medical institutions across the country."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Headache ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research relating to headaches at its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. NINDS also supports and conducts studies to improve the diagnosis of headaches and to find ways to prevent them."
What are the treatments for Cerebellar Hypoplasia ?,"There is no standard course of treatment for cerebellar hypoplasia. Treatment depends upon the underlying disorder and the severity of symptoms. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and supportive."
What is the outlook for Cerebellar Hypoplasia ?,"The prognosis is dependent upon the underlying disorder. Some of the disorders that are associated with cerebellar hypoplasia are progressive, which means the condition will worsen over time, and will most likely have a poor prognosis. Other disorders that feature cerebellar hypoplasia are not progressive, such as those that are the result of abnormal brain formation during fetal development, and might have a better outcome."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Cerebellar Hypoplasia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) supports research related to cerebellar hypoplasia and its associated disorders through grants to major research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders that feature cerebellar hypoplasia."
What is the outlook for Tremor ?,"Although tremor is not life-threatening, it can be embarrassing to some people and make it harder to perform daily tasks."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Tremor ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, a unit of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the nations leading federal funder of research on disorders of the brain and nervous system. The NINDS sponsors research on tremor both at its facilities at the NIH and through grants to medical centers. Scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of certain drugs and searching for genes that can cause certain forms of tremor."
What are the treatments for Sandhoff Disease ?,There is no specific treatment for Sandhoff disease. Supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and keeping the airway open. Anticonvulsants may initially control seizures.
What is the outlook for Sandhoff Disease ?,The prognosis for individuals with Sandhoff disease is poor. Death usually occurs by age 3 and is generally caused by respiratory infections.
What is the outlook for Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome ?,"With treatment, individuals with tethered spinal cord syndrome have a normal life expectancy. However, some neurological and motor impairments may not be fully correctable. Surgery soon after symptoms emerge appears to improve chances for recovery and can prevent further functional decline."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports research on disorders of the spinal cord. The goals of this research are to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders."
What is the outlook for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ?,"PSP gets progressively worse but is not itself directly life-threatening. It does, however, predispose patients to serious complications such as pneumonia secondary to difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). The most common complications are choking and pneumonia, head injury, and fractures caused by falls. The most common cause of death is pneumonia. With good attention to medical and nutritional needs, however, most PSP patients live well into their 70s and beyond."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ?,"Research is ongoing on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Better understanding of those common, related disorders will go a long way toward solving the problem of PSP, just as studying PSP may help shed light on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases."
What is the outlook for Binswanger's Disease ?,"BD is a progressive disease; there is no cure. Changes may be sudden or gradual and then progress in a stepwise manner. BD can often coexist with Alzheimer's disease. Behaviors that slow the progression of high blood pressure, diabetes, and atherosclerosis -- such as eating a healthy diet and keeping healthy wake/sleep schedules, exercising, and not smoking or drinking too much alcohol -- can also slow the progression of BD."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Binswanger's Disease ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to BD in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure neurological disorders, such as BD."
What are the treatments for Dravet Syndrome ?,"Seizures in Dravet syndrome are difficult to control, but can be reduced by anticonvulsant drugs. A ketogenic diet, high in fats and low in carbohydrates, also may be beneficial."
What is the outlook for Dravet Syndrome ?,"As children with Dravet syndrome get older, their decline in cognitive function stabilizes, and in many, it improves slightly. However, most teenagers with Dravet syndrome are dependent on caregivers. The degree of cognitive impairment appears to correlate with the frequency of seizures."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Dravet Syndrome ?,"The NINDS conducts and supports a broad program of basic and clinical research on all types of epilepsy, including Dravet syndrome. Study of the genetic defects responsible for Dravet syndrome and related disorders is expected to lead to the development of effective drug therapies."
What is the outlook for Mucolipidoses ?,"Symptoms of ML can be congenital (present at birth) or begin in early childhood or adolescence. Early symptoms can include skeletal abnormalities, vision problems and developmental delays. Over time, many children with ML develop poor mental capacities, have difficulty reaching normal developmental milestones, and, in many cases, eventually die of the disease."
What are the treatments for Hereditary Neuropathies ?,"There are no standard treatments for hereditary neuropathies. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. Medical treatment includes physical therapy and if needed, pain medication. Orthopedic surgery may be needed to correct severe foot or other skeletal deformities. Bracing may also be used to improve mobility."
What is the outlook for Hereditary Neuropathies ?,The prognosis for individuals with hereditary neuropathies depends upon the type of neuropathy. Some hereditary neuropathies have very mild symptoms and may go undiagnosed for many years. Other types are more severe and are associated with more disabilities. Genetic counseling is important to understand further details about the disease and prognosis.
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Hereditary Neuropathies ?,"The NINDS supports research on neuromuscular disorders, such as hereditary neuropathies, aimed at learning more about these disorders and finding ways to prevent and treat them."
What are the treatments for Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia ?,"Most doctors will attempt to treat the pain first with drugs. Some individuals respond well to anticonvulsant drugs, such as carbamazepine and gabapentin. Surgical options, including nerve resection, tractotomy, or microvascular decompression, should be considered when individuals either dont respond to, or stop responding to, drug therapy. Surgery is usually successful at ending the cycles of pain, although there may be some sensory loss in the mouth, throat, or tongue."
What is the outlook for Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia ?,"Some individuals recover from an initial attack and never have another. Others will experience clusters of attacks followed by periods of short or long remission. Individuals may lose weight if they fear that chewing, drinking, or eating will cause an attack."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes at the National Institutes of Health conduct research related to GN and support additional research through grants to major research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as GN."
What is the outlook for Gaucher Disease ?,"Enzyme replacement therapy is very beneficial for type 1 and most type 3 individuals with this condition. Successful bone marrow transplantation can reverse the non-neurological effects of the disease, but the procedure carries a high risk and is rarely performed in individuals with Gaucher disease."
What are the treatments for Leigh's Disease ?,"The most common treatment for Leigh's disease is thiamine or Vitamin B1. Oral sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate may also be prescribed to manage lactic acidosis. Researchers are currently testing dichloroacetate to establish its effectiveness in treating lactic acidosis. In individuals who have the X-linked form of Leighs disease, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet may be recommended."
What is the outlook for Leigh's Disease ?,"The prognosis for individuals with Leigh's disease is poor.

What is (are) High Blood Cholesterol ?,"Your LDL goal is how low your LDL cholesterol level should be to reduce your risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack. The higher your risk, the lower your goal LDL should be. Your doctor will set your LDL goal using your medical history and the number of risk factors that you have."
What are the treatments for High Blood Cholesterol ?,The main goal of cholesterol-lowering treatment is to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol level enough to reduce your risk of having a heart attack or diseases caused by narrowing of the arteries.
What are the treatments for High Blood Cholesterol ?,There are two main ways to lower your cholesterol: Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes and medicines.
What is (are) Lung Cancer ?,"The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy and functioning properly. Sometimes, however, the process goes wrong -- cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous."
What is (are) Lung Cancer ?,"Lung cancer occurs when malignant tumors form in the tissue of the lung. The lungs are a pair of sponge-like organs. The right lung has three sections, called lobes, and is larger than the left lung, which has two lobes."
Who is at risk for Lung Cancer? ?,"Another substance that can contribute to lung cancer is asbestos. Asbestos is used in shipbuilding, asbestos mining and manufacturing, insulation work, and brake repair, but many products that contain asbestos have been phased out over the past several decades. If inhaled, asbestos particles can lodge in the lungs, damaging cells and increasing the risk for lung cancer."
What is (are) Lung Cancer ?,"A person who has had lung cancer once is more likely to develop a second lung cancer compared to a person who has never had lung cancer. Second cancers arise in a different site than the original cancer. If the original cancer returns after treatment, it is considered recurrent, not a second cancer. Quitting smoking after lung cancer is diagnosed may prevent the development of a second lung cancer."
What are the treatments for Lung Cancer ?,"Doctors treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer in several ways, and surgery is a common treatment. Cryosurgery, a treatment that freezes and destroys cancer tissue, may be used to control symptoms in the later stages of non-small cell lung cancer. Doctors may also use radiation therapy and chemotherapy to slow the progress of the disease and to manage symptoms. See more on treatments for non-small cell lung cancer."
What are the treatments for Lung Cancer ?,"Small cell lung cancer spreads quickly. In many cases, cancer cells have already spread to other parts of the body when the disease is diagnosed, so chemotherapy is usually the best choice. See more on treatments for small cell lung cancer."
What are the treatments for Lung Cancer ?,"Researchers continue to look at new ways to combine, schedule, and sequence the use of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation to treat lung cancer. Targeted therapy, using drugs that go directly to a gene mutation and repair or block the mutation from causing cancer, are the current gold standard for treating some types of lung cancer. Get more information on current lung cancer research."
What are the treatments for Lung Cancer ?,"Researchers are working to develop drugs called ""molecularly targeted agents"" which kill cancer cells by targeting key molecules involved in cancer cell growth."
What is (are) Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a disease that blurs the sharp, central vision you need for straight-ahead activities such as reading, sewing, and driving. AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. AMD causes no pain."
What is (are) Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels behind the retina start to grow under the macula. With wet AMD, loss of central vision can occur quickly. Wet AMD is considered to be advanced AMD and is more severe than the dry form."
What is (are) Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. They often are found in people over age 50. Your eye care professional can detect drusen during a comprehensive dilated eye exam.
What causes Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"Drusen alone do not usually cause vision loss. In fact, scientists are unclear about the connection between drusen and AMD. They do know that an increase in the size or number of drusen raises a person's risk of developing either advanced dry AMD or wet AMD. These changes can cause serious vision loss."
What are the symptoms of Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"An early symptom of wet AMD is that straight lines appear wavy. If you notice this condition or other changes to your vision, contact your eye care professional at once. You need a comprehensive dilated eye exam."
What are the symptoms of Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"The most common symptom of dry AMD is slightly blurred vision. You may have difficulty recognizing faces. You may need more light for reading and other tasks. Dry AMD generally affects both eyes, but vision can be lost in one eye while the other eye seems unaffected. One of the most common early signs of dry AMD is drusen. Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. They often are found in people over age 50. Your eye care professional can detect drusen during a comprehensive dilated eye exam."
Who is at risk for Age-related Macular Degeneration? ?,"AMD is most common in older people, but it can occur during middle age. The risk increases with age. Other risk factors include smoking, obesity, white race, family history of AMD, and female gender."
What are the treatments for Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"Once dry AMD reaches the advanced stage, no form of treatment can prevent vision loss. However, treatment can delay and possibly prevent intermediate AMD from progressing to the advanced stage, in which vision loss occurs."
What is (are) Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"The AREDS formulation is a combination of antioxidants and zinc that is named for a study conducted by The National Eye Institute called the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, or AREDS. This study found that taking a specific high-dose formulation of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduced the risk of advanced AMD and its associated vision loss. Slowing AMD's progression from the intermediate stage to the advanced stage will save many people's vision."
What is (are) Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"The daily amounts used by the study researchers were 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 International Units of vitamin E, 15 milligrams of beta-carotene, 80 milligrams of zinc as zinc oxide, and 2 milligrams of copper as cupric oxide. Copper was added to the AREDS formulation containing zinc to prevent copper deficiency anemia, a condition associated with high levels of zinc intake."
How to prevent Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"There is no reason for those diagnosed with early stage AMD to take the AREDS formulation. The study did not find that the formulation helped those with early stage AMD. If you have early stage AMD, a comprehensive dilated eye exam every year can help determine if the disease is progressing. If early stage AMD progresses to the intermediate stage, discuss taking the formulation with your doctor."
What are the treatments for Age-related Macular Degeneration ?,"Wet AMD can be treated with laser surgery, photodynamic therapy, and drugs that are injected into the eye. None of these treatments is a cure for wet AMD. The disease and loss of vision may progress despite treatment."
What is (are) Osteoarthritis ?,"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis among older people. It affects hands, low back, neck, and weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and feet. Osteoarthritis occurs when cartilage, the tissue that cushions the ends of the bones within the joints, breaks down and wears away. This causes bones to rub together, causing pain, swelling, and loss of motion of the joint."
How many people are affected by Osteoarthritis ?,The chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. It is estimated that 33.6% (12.4 million) of individuals age 65 and older are affected by the disease.
How to diagnose Osteoarthritis ?,"No single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. When a person feels pain in his or her joints, it may or may not be osteoarthritis. The doctor will use a combination of tests to try to determine if osteoarthritis is causing the symptoms. These may include a medical history, a physical examination, x-rays, and laboratory tests. A patient's attitudes, daily activities, and levels of anxiety or depression have a lot to do with how much the symptoms of osteoarthritis affect day-to-day living."
What are the treatments for Osteoarthritis ?,"Warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower can provide temporary pain relief. Medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, help reduce pain and inflammation that result from osteoarthritis. A doctor or physical therapist can recommend if heat or cold is the best treatment. For osteoarthritis in the knee, wearing insoles or cushioned shoes may reduce joint stress."
What is (are) Breast Cancer ?,"The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy. Sometimes, however, the process goes wrong. Cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, which means not cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous."
What is (are) Breast Cancer ?,Breast cancer occurs when a malignant tumor forms in the breast tissue. The cancer can be found in the breast itself or in the ducts and lymph nodes that surround the breast.
What is (are) Breast Cancer ?,"When cancer spreads from its original location in the breast to another part of the body such as the brain, it is called metastatic breast cancer, not brain cancer. Doctors sometimes call this ""distant"" disease."
What is (are) Breast Cancer ?,"A mammogram can often detect breast changes in women who have no signs of breast cancer. Often, it can find a breast lump before it can be felt. If the results indicate that cancer might be present, your doctor will advise you to have a follow-up test called a biopsy."
What are the treatments for Breast Cancer ?,"Even if the surgeon removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, a woman may still receive follow-up treatment. This may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. Treatment that a patient receives after surgery to increase the chances of a cure is called adjuvant therapy."
What are the treatments for Breast Cancer ?,"Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. This therapy often follows a lumpectomy, and is sometimes used after mastectomy. During radiation therapy, a machine outside the body sends high-energy beams to kill the cancer cells that may still be present in the affected breast or in nearby lymph nodes. Doctors sometimes use radiation therapy along with chemotherapy, or before or instead of surgery."
What are the treatments for Breast Cancer ?,"Certain drugs that have been used successfully in other cancers are now being used to treat some breast cancers. A mix of drugs may increase the length of time you will live, or the length of time you will live without cancer. In addition, certain drugs like Herceptin and Tykerb taken in combination with chemotherapy, can help women with specific genetic breast cancer mutations better than chemotherapy alone."
What is (are) Glaucoma ?,The optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibers. It connects the retina to the brain.
Who is at risk for Glaucoma? ?,"Anyone can develop glaucoma. Some people are at higher risk than others. They include - African-Americans over age 40 - everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos - people with a family history of glaucoma. African-Americans over age 40 everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos people with a family history of glaucoma. See this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma, including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more."
How to prevent Glaucoma ?,"At this time, we do not know how to prevent glaucoma. However, studies have shown that the early detection and treatment of glaucoma, before it causes major vision loss, is the best way to control the disease. So, if you fall into one of the higher risk groups for the disease, make sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every one to two years. Get tips on finding an eye care professional. Learn what a comprehensive dilated eye exam involves."
What are the symptoms of Glaucoma ?,"At first, open-angle glaucoma has no symptoms. It causes no pain. Vision seems normal. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains."
What are the treatments for Glaucoma ?,"Yes. Immediate treatment for early stage, open-angle glaucoma can delay progression of the disease. That's why early diagnosis is very important. Glaucoma treatments include medicines, laser surgery, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these. While these treatments may save remaining vision, they do not improve sight already lost from glaucoma."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Glaucoma ?,"Through studies in the laboratory and with patients, the National Eye Institute is seeking better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with glaucoma. For example, researchers have discovered genes that could help explain how glaucoma damages the eye. NEI also is supporting studies to learn more about who is likely to get glaucoma, when to treat people who have increased eye pressure, and which treatment to use first."
Who is at risk for Glaucoma? ?,Encourage them to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every two years. Remember -- lowering eye pressure in glaucoma's early stages slows progression of the disease and helps save vision. Get tips on finding an eye care professional.

What causes Kidney Disease ?,"Kidney disease is most often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure. Each kidney contains about one million tiny filters made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Diabetes and high blood pressure damage these blood vessels, so the kidneys are not able to filter the blood as well as they used to. Usually this damage happens slowly, over many years. As more and more filters are damaged, the kidneys eventually stop working."
What is (are) Kidney Disease ?,"When you visit your doctor, here are questions to ask about your kidneys. - What is my GFR? - What is my urine albumin result? - What is my blood pressure? - What is my blood glucose (for people with diabetes)? What is my GFR? What is my urine albumin result? What is my blood pressure? What is my blood glucose (for people with diabetes)?"
What is (are) Kidney Disease ?,"When your kidneys fail, they are no longer able to filter blood and remove waste from your body well enough to maintain health. Kidney failure causes harmful waste and excess fluid to build up in your body. Your blood pressure may rise, and your hands and feet may swell. Since the kidneys are not working well, the goal is to find treatments that can replace kidney function in order to maintain health. There are two main options for this: dialysis and transplantation."
What is (are) Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) ?,"Peripheral arterial disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque (plak) builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrous tissue, and other substances in the blood. P.A.D. currently affects millions of Americans, and about 1 in every 20 Americans over the age of 50 has P.A.D."
What causes Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) ?,"The most common cause of P.A.D. is atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries. Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body."
What are the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis ?,"Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joint lining. This inflammation causes warmth, redness, swelling, and pain around the joints. The pain of rheumatoid arthritis varies greatly from person to person, for reasons that doctors do not yet understand completely. Factors that contribute to the pain include swelling within the joint, the amount of heat or redness present, or damage that has occurred within the joint."
How to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis ?,"Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the full range of symptoms develops over time, and only a few symptoms may be present in the early stages. As part of the diagnosis, your doctor will look for symptoms such as swelling, warmth, pain, and limitations in joint motion throughout your body. Your doctor may ask you questions about the intensity of your pain symptoms, how often they occur, and what makes the pain better or worse."
What are the symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy ?,Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Don't wait for symptoms. Be sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Learn more about a comprehensive dilated eye exam.
What is (are) Diabetic Retinopathy ?,"In this test, a special dye is injected into your arm. Pictures are taken as the dye passes through the blood vessels in your retina. The test allows your eye care professional to identify any leaking blood vessels and recommend treatment."
What are the treatments for Diabetic Retinopathy ?,"Yes. Both treatments are very effective in reducing vision loss. People with proliferative retinopathy can reduce their risk of blindness by 95 percent with timely treatment and appropriate follow-up care. Although both treatments have high success rates, they do not cure diabetic retinopathy. Once you have proliferative retinopathy, you always will be at risk for new bleeding. You may need treatment more than once to protect your sight."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Diabetic Retinopathy ?,"The National Eye Institute, or NEI, is conducting and supporting research that seeks better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with diabetes. This research is conducted through studies in the laboratory and with patients. For example, researchers are studying drugs for the treatment of proliferative retinopathy that may reduce the need for laser surgery."

What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,"Addiction is a chronic disease in which a person craves, seeks, and continues to abuse a legal (medication, alcohol, tobacco) or an illicit (illegal) drug, despite harmful consequences. People who are addicted continue to abuse the substance even though it can harm their physical or mental health, lead to accidents, or put others in danger. For more on drugs and the brain, see Drugs, Brains and Behavior: The Science of Addiction."
What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,Marijuana is the most abused illicit drug among people 50 and older.
What are the symptoms of Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,"Not always. Some warning signs, such as sleep problems, falls, mood swings, anxiety, depression, and memory problems -- can also be signs of other health conditions. As a result, doctors and family members often do not realize that an older person has a drug problem, and people may not get the help they need."
What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,People can receive treatment as outpatients (they live at home and visit the doctor or other provider) or through inpatient services (they live temporarily at a special facility where they get treatment). The support of family and friends is important during the treatment process.
What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?,"Recovering from addiction is hard. Even with treatment, many people return to substance abuse, sometimes months or years after having stopped drug use. This is commonly referred to as relapse. As with most chronic diseases, relapse in addiction is not unusual, and signals a need to restart, adjust, or modify the treatment."
What is (are) COPD ?,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a progressive lung disease in which the airways of the lungs become damaged, making it harder to breathe. With COPD, airways become blocked, making it harder to get air in and out."
What causes COPD ?,"Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD. Most people with COPD are smokers or have been smokers in the past. Breathing in other fumes and dusts over long periods of time can also lead to COPD. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoking can cause COPD, especially if the smoke is inhaled. Exposure to secondhand smoke can play a role in causing COPD. Most people with COPD are at least 40 years old or around middle age when symptoms start."
What are the symptoms of COPD ?,"The most common symptoms of COPD are a cough that does not go away and coughing up a lot of sputum (mucus). These symptoms may occur years before lung damage has reduced the flow of air in and out of the lungs. Other symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, especially with exercise; wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe); and tightness in the chest."
How to diagnose COPD ?,"To confirm a COPD diagnosis, a doctor will use a breathing test called spirometry. The test is easy and painless. It shows how well the lungs are working. The spirometer measures how much air the lungs can hold and how fast air is blown out of the lungs. Other tests, such as bronchodilator reversibility testing, a chest X-ray, and arterial blood gas test, may be ordered."
What are the treatments for COPD ?,"Treatment for COPD can be different for each person and is based on whether symptoms are mild, moderate or severe. Treatments include medication, pulmonary or lung rehabilitation, oxygen treatment, and surgery. There are also treatments to manage complications or a sudden onset of symptoms."
How to diagnose COPD ?,"If you have not been exercising regularly, you should get the advice of your doctor before starting. The symptoms of COPD are different for each person. People with mild COPD may not have much difficulty walking or exercising. As the symptoms of COPD get worse over time, a person may have more difficulty with walking and exercising. You should talk to your doctor about exercising and whether you would benefit from a pulmonary or lung rehabilitation program."
How to prevent COPD ?,"If you smoke, the most important thing you can do to prevent more lung damage is to stop smoking. It is also important to stay away from people who smoke and places where you know there will be smokers. Avoid exposure to pollutants like dust, fumes, and poor air quality, and take precautions to prevent flu and pneumonia. Following your doctor's instructions with medications and rehabilitative treatment can help alleviate COPD symptoms and control the disabling effects of the disease."
What are the treatments for COPD ?,"Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids are two medications used to treat COPD. Bronchodilators work by relaxing the muscles around the airways, opening them and making it easier to breathe. People with mild COPD take bronchodilators using an inhaler only when needed. Those with moderate or severe COPD may need more regular treatment. Inhaled steroids also are used for people with moderate or severe COPD in order to reduce swelling in the airways."
What are the symptoms of COPD ?,"Call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. People with COPD may have symptoms that suddenly get worse. When this happens, you have a much harder time catching your breath. Symptoms that worsen suddenly can include sudden chest tightness, more coughing, a change in your sputum (mucus), or fever. Your doctor will look at things that may be causing these sudden symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms are caused by a lung infection."
What is (are) COPD ?,"More information on COPD is available at: What is COPD? and at the Learn More, Breathe Better Campaign For information on quitting smoking, visit http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco/ or Smokefree.gov. For information on the H1N1 flu and COPD, go to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?,"Home health care is short-term skilled care at home after hospitalization or for the treatment of an illness or injury. Home health agencies provide home care services, including skilled nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, medical social work, and care by home health aides. Home health services may also include durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, hospital beds, oxygen, and walkers, and medical supplies for use at home."
What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?,"Hospice care is a special way of caring for people who are terminally ill (dying) and helping their families cope. Hospice care includes treatment to relieve symptoms and keep the individual comfortable. The goal is to provide end-of-life care, not to cure the illness. Medical care, nursing care, social services, drugs for the terminal and related conditions, durable medical equipment, and other types of items and services can be a part of hospice care."
What is (are) Dry Mouth ?,"Saliva does more than keep your mouth wet. It helps digest food, protects teeth from decay, helps to heal sores in your mouth, and prevents infection by controlling bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the mouth. Saliva is also what helps us chew and swallow. Each of these functions of saliva is hampered when a person has dry mouth."
What are the symptoms of Dry Mouth ?,"Dry mouth can be uncomfortable. Some people notice a sticky, dry feeling in the mouth. Others notice a burning feeling or difficulty while eating. The throat may feel dry, too, and swallowing without extra fluids can often be difficult. Also, people with dry mouth may develop mouth sores, cracked lips, and a dry, rough tongue."
What causes Dry Mouth ?,"Yes. More than 400 medicines, including some over-the-counter medications, can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva, or to change the composition of the saliva so that it can't perform the functions it should. As an example, medicines for urinary incontinence, allergies, high blood pressure, and depression often cause dry mouth."
What are the treatments for Dry Mouth ?,"Certain cancer treatments can affect the salivary glands. Head and neck radiation therapy can cause the glands to produce little or no saliva. Chemotherapy may cause the salivary glands to produce thicker saliva, which makes the mouth feel dry and sticky."
What causes Dry Mouth ?,Some diseases affect the salivary glands. Sjgren's syndrome and diabetes can cause dry mouth. Injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva.
What is (are) Dry Mouth ?,"Sjgren's Syndrome Clinic National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Building 10, Room 1N113 10 Center Drive MSC 1190 Bethesda, MD 20892-1190 301-435-8528 http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/Research/NIDCRLaboratories/ MolecularPhysiology/SjogrensSyndrome/default.htm"

What is (are) Prostate Cancer ?,"The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy. Sometimes, however, the process goes wrong -- cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, which means not cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous."
What is (are) Prostate Cancer ?,"The prostate is a male sex gland, about the size of a large walnut. It is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate's main function is to make fluid for semen, a white substance that carries sperm. Prostate cancer occurs when a tumor forms in the tissue of the prostate. In its early stage, prostate cancer needs the male hormone testosterone to grow and survive."
How many people are affected by Prostate Cancer ?,"Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among American men. It is a slow-growing disease that mostly affects older men. In fact, more than 60 percent of all prostate cancers are found in men over the age of 65. The disease rarely occurs in men younger than 40 years of age."
What is (are) Prostate Cancer ?,"Sometimes, cancer cells break away from the malignant tumor in the prostate and enter the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and travel to other organs in the body. When cancer spreads from its original location in the prostate to another part of the body such as the bone, it is called metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer. Doctors sometimes call this ""distant"" disease."
What causes Prostate Cancer ?,"Scientists don't know exactly what causes prostate cancer. They cannot explain why one man gets prostate cancer and another does not. However, they have been able to identify some risk factors that are associated with the disease. A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of getting a disease."
Who is at risk for Prostate Cancer? ?,"Age is the most important risk factor for prostate cancer. The disease is extremely rare in men under age 40, but the risk increases greatly with age. More than 60 percent of cases are diagnosed in men over age 65. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 65."
Who is at risk for Prostate Cancer? ?,"Scientists have wondered whether obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, and radiation exposure, might increase risk. But at this time, there is no conclusive evidence that any of these factors contribute to an increased risk."
What are the symptoms of Prostate Cancer ?,"Yes. Any of the symptoms caused by prostate cancer may also be due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. If you have any of the symptoms mentioned in question #10, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system."
How to diagnose Prostate Cancer ?,"Doctors use tests to detect prostate abnormalities, but tests cannot show whether abnormalities are cancer or another, less serious condition. The results from these tests will help the doctor decide whether to check the patient further for signs of cancer. The most common test is a blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA -- a lab measures the levels of PSA in a blood sample. The level of PSA may rise in men who have prostate cancer, an enlarged prostate, or infection in the prostate."
What are the treatments for Prostate Cancer ?,"Surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy all have the potential to disrupt sexual desire or performance for a short while or permanently. Discuss your concerns with your health care provider. Several options are available to help you manage sexual problems related to prostate cancer treatment."
What is (are) Prostate Cancer ?,"Surgery is a common treatment for early stage prostate cancer. It is used to remove the cancer. The surgeon may remove the entire prostate -- a type of surgery called radical prostatectomy -- or, in some cases, remove only part of it. Sometimes the surgeon will also remove nearby lymph nodes. Side effects may include lack of sexual function (impotence), or problems holding urine (incontinence)."
What are the treatments for Prostate Cancer ?,"Hormonal therapy deprives cancer cells of the male hormones they need to grow and survive. This treatment is often used for prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Sometimes doctors use hormonal therapy to try to keep the cancer from coming back after surgery or radiation treatment. Side effects can include impotence, hot flashes, loss of sexual desire, and thinning of bones."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,"Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. If your blood pressure rises and stays high over time, its called high blood pressure. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes."
What are the treatments for High Blood Pressure ?,"High blood pressure is treated with lifestyle changes and medicines. Treatment can help control blood pressure, but it will not cure high blood pressure, even if your blood pressure readings appear normal. If you stop treatment, your blood pressure and risk for related health problems will rise. For a healthy future, follow your treatment plan closely. Work with your health care team for lifelong blood pressure control."
What are the treatments for High Blood Pressure ?,"In most cases, the goal is probably to keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg (130/80 if you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease). Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80. Ask your doctor what your blood pressure goal should be. If you have high blood pressure, you will need to treat it and control it for life. This means making lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, taking prescribed medicines, and getting ongoing medical care."
What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?,"Only a small amount of the salt that we eat comes from the salt shaker, and only small amounts occur naturally in food. Most of the salt that we eat comes from processed foods -- for example, canned or processed meat, baked goods, and certain cereals, and foods with soy sauce, seasoned salts, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and baking soda. Food from fast food restaurants, frozen foods, and canned foods also tend to be higher in sodium."
What is (are) Heart Failure ?,"In heart failure, the heart cannot pump enough blood through the body. Heart failure develops over time as the pumping action of the heart gets weaker. Heart failure does not mean that the heart has stopped working or is about to stop working. When the heart is weakened by heart failure, blood and fluid can back up into the lungs and fluid builds up in the feet, ankles, and legs. People with heart failure often experience tiredness and shortness of breath."
What causes Heart Failure ?,"Heart failure is caused by other diseases and conditions that damage the heart muscle. It is most commonly caused by coronary artery disease, including heart attack. Diabetes and high blood pressure also contribute to heart failure risk. People who have had a heart attack are at high risk of developing heart failure."
What are the symptoms of Heart Failure ?,"The most common symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, feeling tired, and swelling. Swelling is caused by fluid build-up in the body. Fluid buildup can lead to weight gain and frequent urination, as well as coughing."
How many people are affected by Heart Failure ?,"Approximately 5 million people in the United States have heart failure. It contributes to 300,000 deaths each year. It is the number one cause of hospitalizations for people over the age of 65."
What are the treatments for Heart Failure ?,Treatment for heart failure includes lifestyle changes medications specialized care for those in advanced stages of the disease.
What are the treatments for Heart Failure ?,Lifestyle changes to treat heart failure may include - reducing salt and fluid intake - following a heart healthy diet - adopting a plan to lose weight - quitting smoking - engaging in physical activity. reducing salt and fluid intake following a heart healthy diet adopting a plan to lose weight quitting smoking engaging in physical activity.
What are the treatments for Heart Failure ?,"Many medications are used to manage heart failure. They include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and digoxin. Diuretics are used to reduce fluid buildup. ACE inhibitors work to improve heart failure in many ways, including lowering blood pressure. Beta blockers can also improve heart failure in many ways, including slowing the heart rate. Digoxin affects the hormones that worsen heart failure."
What are the treatments for Heart Failure ?,"For severe heart failure, patients may require additional oxygen, a mechanical heart pump, or a heart transplant."

What is (are) Problems with Taste ?,"Taste is the ability to detect different sensations in the mouth, such as sweet or salty. It is part of your body's chemical sensing system. Taste combines with other oral sensations, such as texture, spiciness, temperature, and aroma to produce what is commonly referred to as flavor."
How many people are affected by Problems with Taste ?,"Roughly 200,000 people each year visit a doctor for a chemosensory problem such as a taste disorder. Many more taste disorders go unreported."
What causes Problems with Taste ?,"The most common causes of taste disorders are medications, infections, head trauma, and dental problems. Most people who have a problem with taste are taking certain medications or they have had a head or neck injury. Gum disease, dry mouth, and dentures can contribute to taste problems, too. Other causes are radiation therapy for head and neck cancers, smoking, and some surgeries."
What is (are) Depression ?,"Depression is more than just feeling blue or sad. It is an illness. When you have depression, it interferes with daily life and normal functioning, and causes pain for both you and those who care about you."
What is (are) Creating a Family Health History ?,"A family health history is a written record of the diseases and health conditions within a family. It provides information about family members' medical histories, lifestyle habits, and early living environments."
What is (are) Creating a Family Health History ?,"A heritable disease is caused by a mutation, or harmful change, in a gene inherited from a parent. Genes are small structures in your body's cells that determine how you look and tell your body how to work. Examples of heritable diseases are Huntington's disease, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophy. Most diseases that run in the family are not strictly genetic. Learn basic information about chromosomes. Learn basic information about DNA."
What is (are) Creating a Family Health History ?,Talk to other family members. You can also obtain a death certificate from a state or county vital statistics office to confirm a late relative's cause of death. Funeral homes and online obituaries may also have this information.
What is (are) Creating a Family Health History ?,"In a genetic test, a small sample of blood, saliva, or tissue is taken to examine a person's genes. Sometimes, genetic testing can detect diseases that may be preventable or treatable. This type of testing is available for thousands of conditions."
What are the symptoms of Diabetes ?,"Many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. Some lose weight without trying. Additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. Some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all."
What causes Dry Eye ?,"Most people with dry eye will not have serious problems, but severe dry eye may lead to inflammation, ulcers, or scars on the cornea, and some loss of vision. Permanent loss of vision from dry eye is uncommon."
What causes Dry Eye ?,"If your eyes dont make enough tears it can cause dry eye. Anything that changes the components of tears can cause dry eye. Many factors can lead to dry eye, including aging, medications, problems with eyelid function, disease, some types of eye surgery, environmental factors, and allergies."

What is (are) Alzheimer's Disease ?,"Alzheimers disease is a brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. It begins slowly and gets worse over time. Currently, it has no cure. Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia in older people. Get more details about Alzheimer's disease."
What is (are) Alzheimer's Disease ?,"Dementia is a loss of thinking, remembering, and reasoning skills that interferes with a persons daily life and activities. Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia among older people. Dementia ranges in severity from the mild stage, when it is just beginning to affect a persons functioning, to the severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for care."
What is (are) Alzheimer's Disease ?,"Memory problems are typically one of the first signs of Alzheimers disease, though different people may have different initial symptoms. A decline in other aspects of thinking, such as finding the right words, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning or judgment, may also signal the very early stages of Alzheimers disease."
How to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease ?,"An early, accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease helps people and their families plan for the future. It gives them time to discuss care options, find support, and make legal and financial arrangements while the person with Alzheimers can still take part in making decisions. Also, even though no medicine or other treatment can stop or slow the disease, early diagnosis offers the best chance to treat the symptoms."
How to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease ?,The time from diagnosis of Alzheimers disease to death varies. It can be as little as 3 or 4 years if the person is over 80 years old when diagnosed or as long as 10 years or more if the person is younger.
How to prevent Alzheimer's Disease ?,"A number of studies suggest that eating certain foods may help keep the brain healthyand that others can be harmful. Researchers are looking at whether a healthy dietone that includes lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and is low in fat and added sugarcan help prevent Alzheimers. For more information about healthy eating as you age, see Eating Well As You Get Older."
How to prevent Alzheimer's Disease ?,"Keeping the mind sharpthrough social engagement or intellectual stimulationis associated with a lower risk of Alzheimers disease. Activities like working, volunteering, reading, going to lectures, and playing computer and other games are being studied to see if they might help prevent Alzheimers. But we do not know with certainty whether these activities can actually prevent Alzheimers. Find out about things you can do that may keep your brain healthy."
Who is at risk for Shingles? ?,"Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60-to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles."
What is (are) Shingles ?,"""A burning, tingly feeling is what I noticed first,"" said an elderly woman describing her symptoms. ""I looked in the mirror, and there was a rash on just one side of my back. Then the shooting pains started. Days later, I could hardly stand to have my clothes touching me. I thought maybe I had hives or poison ivy,"" she said, ""until I went to the doctor."""
What are the symptoms of Shingles ?,"A week or two after the blisters erupt, the oozing sores will begin to crust over. The sores are usually gone after another two weeks. The pain usually decreases over the next few weeks, but some patients may have pain for months -- sometimes, for years."
What is (are) Psoriasis ?,"Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease. Chronic means that it lasts a long time, often a lifetime. Psoriasis affects more than 5 million adults in the United States. It appears about equally in males and females. Psoriasis occurs when the skin cells grow too quickly. The body does not shed these excess cells and they build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick, scaly patches."
What is (are) Psoriasis ?,"The most common form of psoriasis is called plaque psoriasis. It appears as raised red patches covered in silvery white scales. Plaque psoriasis usually shows up on the scalp, knees, elbows, and lower back. The patches may itch or be painful. They can also crack and bleed."
What causes Psoriasis ?,"Although the cause of psoriasis is not completely understood, scientists believe it is related to a problem with a type of blood cells called T cells. These cells normally travel through the bloodstream to help fight an infection, but in people with psoriasis, they attack the bodys skin cells by mistake."
How to diagnose Psoriasis ?,"In most cases, your primary care doctor can diagnose psoriasis simply by examining your skin. If your doctor isn't sure if you have psoriasis, he or she may order a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of skin and looking at it under a microscope."
What are the treatments for Psoriasis ?,"The goals of psoriasis treatment are to change the course of the disease by interfering with the increased production of skin cells, and to remove scales and smooth rough skin."
What are the treatments for Psoriasis ?,There are many types of treatments. Many are medicines and other treatments your doctor will have to prescribe. But there are other types of treatments you can buy without a prescription or try on your own. Some treatments for psoriasis are applied to the directly to the skin. Some use light to treat skin lesions. Others are taken by mouth or injected.
What are the treatments for Psoriasis ?,"Topical treatments are those that are applied directly to the skin. Topical treatments for psoriasis include - salicylic acid, - steroid-based creams - calcipotriene-containing ointment - anthralin - coal-tar ointments and shampoos - and vitamin D analogues. salicylic acid, steroid-based creams calcipotriene-containing ointment anthralin coal-tar ointments and shampoos and vitamin D analogues."
What is (are) Psoriasis ?,"Oral or injected medications for psoriasis include methotrexate, cycloclosporine, oral retinoids, and biologics. These therapies, prescribed by your doctor, work in different ways to help control the underlying disease process."
What is (are) Psoriasis ?,"Light therapy, also called phototherapy, uses ultraviolet light to treat skin lesions. Laser therapy delivers intense, focused doses of light to specific areas of the skin to clear lesions without harming surrounding tissues."
What are the treatments for Psoriasis ?,"For many people, natural treatments can help relieve the symptoms of psoriasis. There are many natural treatments you can try on your own, but you should never use them to replace the treatment your doctor prescribes. Some natural treatments you may want to try are - sunlight - aloe - fish oil - Dead Sea salts - cayenne. sunlight aloe fish oil Dead Sea salts cayenne."
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Psoriasis ?,"Scientists who are working to better understand and treat psoriasis are making headway in several different areas, including the role of T cells, new treatments, psoriasis genes, psoriasis-related conditions, and stress-reduction treatment."
What is (are) Heart Attack ?,"A heart attack occurs when the supply of blood and oxygen to an area of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot in a coronary artery. If the blockage is not treated within a few hours, the heart muscle will be permanently damaged and replaced by scar tissue."
What causes Heart Attack ?,"Coronary heart disease, or CHD, is the most common underlying cause of a heart attack. Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries. When blood cannot reach part of your heart, that area starves for oxygen. If the blockage continues long enough, cells in the affected area die."
What are the symptoms of Heart Attack ?,"No. Most heart attack patients do not have all of the symptoms. The important thing to remember is that if you have any of the symptoms and they grow more intense, and last more than 5 minutes, you should call 9-1-1 immediately."
How many people are affected by Heart Attack ?,"Very common. Each year, more than 1 million people in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half of them die. About one-half of those who die do so within 1 hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital."
What are the treatments for Heart Attack ?,"After a heart attack, many people worry about having another heart attack. They often feel depressed and may have trouble adjusting to a new lifestyle. You should discuss your feelings with your doctor. Your doctor can give you medication for anxiety or depression and may recommend professional counseling. Spend time with family, friends, and even pets. Affection can make you feel better and less lonely. Most people stop feeling depressed after they have fully recovered."
What is (are) Heart Attack ?,More detailed information on heart attacks is available at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci.
What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?,"The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy and functioning properly. Sometimes, however, the process goes wrong. Cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, which means non-cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous."
What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?,"Cancer of the colon or rectum is called colorectal cancer. The colon and the rectum are part of the large intestine, which is part of the digestive system. Colorectal cancer occurs when malignant tumors form in the lining of the large intestine, also called the large bowel."
How many people are affected by Colorectal Cancer ?,Colorectal cancer accounts for almost ten percent of all cancer deaths in the United States. The risk of developing colorectal cancer rises after age 50. It is common in both men and women.
Who is at risk for Colorectal Cancer? ?,"Studies show that the following risk factors may increase a person's chances of developing colorectal cancer: age, polyps, personal history, family history, and ulcerative colitis."
Who is at risk for Colorectal Cancer? ?,Yes. Ulcerative colitis is a condition in which there is a chronic break in the lining of the colon. It has been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer.
What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?,"Parents, siblings, or children of a person who has had colorectal cancer are somewhat more likely to develop this type of cancer themselves. This is especially true if the relative had the cancer at a young age. If many family members have had colorectal cancer, the chances increase even more."
What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?,"Yes. In July 2008, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force made its strongest ever recommendation for colorectal cancer screening: it suggested that all adults between ages 50 and 75 get screened, or tested, for the disease. The task force noted that various screening tests are available, making it possible for patients and their clinicians to decide which test is best for each person."
What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?,"The three standard treatments for colon cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Surgery, however, is the most common first step in the treatment for all stages of colon cancer. Surgery is an operation to remove the cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using several types of surgery. For rectal cancer, radiation treatment also is an option."
What are the treatments for Colorectal Cancer ?,"For surgery, the main side effects are short-term pain and tenderness around the area of the operation. For chemotherapy, the side effects depend on which drugs you take and what the dosages are. Most often the side effects include nausea, vomiting, and hair loss. For radiation therapy, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and diarrhea may occur. There are many new drugs that have greatly reduced the degree of nausea that used to be experienced because of some of these treatments."
Who is at risk for Colorectal Cancer? ?,"Researchers are working hard to understand and identify the genes involved in colorectal cancer. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC, is one condition that causes people to develop colorectal cancer at a young age. The discovery of four genes involved with this disease has provided crucial clues about the role of DNA repair in colorectal and other cancers."
What is (are) Osteoporosis ?,"Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens the bones to the point that they break easily. Women and men with osteoporosis most often break bones in the hip, spine, and wrist, but osteoporosis can be the cause of bone fractures anywhere."
Who is at risk for Osteoporosis? ?,"Women have smaller bones, and they lose bone more rapidly than men because of hormone changes that occur after menopause. Therefore, women are at higher risk for osteoporosis."
What is (are) Urinary Incontinence ?,"Urinary incontinence means a person leaks urine by accident. Urinary incontinence is a common bladder problem as people age. Women are more likely than men to leak urine. If this problem is happening to you, there is help. Urinary incontinence can often be controlled. Talk to your health care provider about what you can do. Learn about urinary incontinence in women. Learn about urinary incontinence in men."
What is (are) Stroke ?,"Some brain cells die because they stop getting the oxygen and nutrients they need to function. Other brain cells die because they are damaged by sudden bleeding into or around the brain. The brain cells that don't die immediately remain at risk for death. These cells can linger in a compromised or weakened state for several hours. With timely treatment these cells can be saved. Knowing stroke symptoms, calling 911 immediately, and getting to a hospital as quickly as possible are critical."
Who is at risk for Stroke? ?,"Stroke occurs in all age groups, in both sexes, and in all races in every country. It can even occur before birth, when the fetus is still in the womb. Studies show the risk of stroke doubles for each decade between the ages of 55 and 85. However, a recent study found that stroke rates are on the rise for people under 55."
What is (are) Stroke ?,There are two kinds of stroke. The most common kind of stroke is called ischemic stroke. It accounts for approximately 80 percent of all strokes. An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.
What is (are) Stroke ?,"Transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs, occur when the warning signs of stroke last only a few moments and then disappear. These brief episodes are also sometimes called ""mini-strokes."" Although brief, they identify an underlying serious condition that isn't going away without medical help. Unfortunately, since they clear up, many people ignore them. Don't ignore them. Heeding them can save your life."
What is (are) Stroke ?,"Atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries, is the most common blood vessel disease. It is caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, and is a risk factor for stroke."
What are the treatments for Stroke ?,"With stroke, treatment depends on the stage of the disease. There are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after stroke, and rehabilitation after stroke. Stroke treatments include medications, surgery, and rehabilitation."
What is (are) Stroke ?,"Brain plasticity is the brain's ability to learn and change, allowing it to adapt to deficits and injury and to take over the functions of damaged cells. When cells in an area of the brain responsible for a particular function die after a stroke, the patient becomes unable to perform that function. However, the brain's ability torewire the connections between its nerve cells allows it to compensate for lost functions."
What is (are) Stroke ?,"For more information on stroke, including research sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, call 1-800-352-9424 or visit the Web site at www.ninds.nih.gov."
What is (are) Leukemia ?,"Cancer begins in cells, which make up the blood and other tissues. Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy and functioning properly. Sometimes, however, the process of creating a new cell goes wrong -- cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way."
What is (are) Leukemia ?,"Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. It usually begins in the bone marrow where blood cells are formed. In leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. Over time, as the number of abnormal white blood cells builds up in the blood, they crowd out healthy blood cells. This makes it difficult for the blood to carry out its normal functions."
What is (are) Leukemia ?,"Acute leukemia gets worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, symptoms develop gradually and are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia."
What is (are) Leukemia ?,"Myeloma and lymphoma are other types of blood cancers. Both are common among older adults and occur more often in men than women. Myeloma affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cells typically found in the bone marrow. Lymphoma starts in the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system. Learn more about myeloma."
How to diagnose Leukemia ?,There are no standard or over-the-counter tests for leukemia. Your doctor can request lab analyses for leukemia that include blood tests that check the levels and types of blood cells and look for changes in the shape of blood cells. The doctor may also look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow or the fluid around the brain or the spinal cord
What are the treatments for Leukemia ?,"Treatment depends on a number of factors, including the type of leukemia, the patient's age and general health, where leukemia cells have collected in the body, and whether the leukemia has been treated before. Certain features of the leukemia cells and the patient's symptoms also may determine treatment options."
What are the treatments for Leukemia ?,"Standard treatments for leukemia include chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Some patients receive a combination of treatments. Learn more about treatments for acute myeloid leukemia. Learn more about treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia."
What is (are) Leukemia ?,"Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. This is the most common treatment for most types of leukemia. Chemotherapy may be taken by mouth in pill form, by injection directly into a vein, or through a catheter. If leukemia cells are found in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, the doctor may inject drugs directly into the fluid to ensure that the drugs reach the leukemia cells in the brain."
What is (are) Leukemia ?,"Biological therapy is a treatment that uses a person's own immune system to fight leukemia. This therapy uses special substances to stimulate the immune system's ability to fight cancer. Some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receive monoclonal antibodies, which are man-made proteins that can identify leukemia cells and help the body kill them."
What is (are) Leukemia ?,Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells. Some patients receive radiation treatment that is directed at the whole body.
How many people are affected by Hearing Loss ?,"Approximately 17 percent, or 36 million, of American adults say that they have some degree of hearing loss. Hearing loss is a common condition in older adults. Roughly one-third of Americans 65 to 74 years of age and 47 percent of those 75 and older have hearing loss."
What causes Hearing Loss ?,"Hearing loss can result from taking certain medications. ""Ototoxic"" medications damage the inner ear, sometimes permanently. Check with your doctor if you notice a problem while taking a medication."
How to prevent Hearing Loss ?,"Washing your hands frequently can help prevent upper respiratory infections, which can lead to an ear infection called otitis media. The ear infection otitis media can be a cause of long-term hearing loss. Also, ask your doctor about a yearly flu shot to help prevent flu-related ear infections. If you still get an ear infection, see a doctor immediately before it becomes more serious."
What is (are) Parkinson's Disease ?,"Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. It currently affects about half a million people in the United States, although the numbers may be much higher. Parkinson's disease is both chronic, meaning it lasts for a long time, and progressive, meaning its symptoms grow worse over time. It is not contagious."
Who is at risk for Parkinson's Disease? ?,"About 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease each year. The disease strikes about 50 percent more men than women. The average age of onset is 60 years, and the risk of developing the disease increases with age. Parkinson's disease is also more common in developed countries, possibly because of increased exposure to pesticides or other environmental toxins."
What causes Parkinson's Disease ?,"Parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells, or neurons, in an area of the brain that controls movement die or become impaired. Normally, these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine, but once the neurons become impaired, they produce less dopamine and eventually die. It is this shortage of dopamine that causes the movement problems of people with Parkinson's."
What is (are) Parkinson's Disease ?,"Dopamine is a brain chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter. It is responsible for transmitting signals between a brain region called the substantia nigra and multiple brain regions. The connection between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum is critical to produce smooth, purposeful movement. Loss of dopamine results in abnormal nerve-firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement."
What is (are) Parkinson's Disease ?,"The main therapy for Parkinson's disease is the drug levodopa, also called L-dopa. It is a simple chemical found naturally in plants and animals. Nerve cells use levodopa to make dopamine to replenish the brain's supply. Levodopa helps to reduce tremors and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease during the early stages of the disease. It allows most people with Parkinson's to extend the period of time in which they can lead relatively normal, productive lives."
What is (are) Parkinson's Disease ?,Carbidopa is a drug that is usually given along with levodopa. It delays the body's conversion of levodopa into dopamine until the levodopa reaches the brain. This prevents or reduces some of the side effects that often accompany levodopa therapy. Carbidopa also reduces the amount of levodopa needed.
What is (are) Parkinson's Disease ?,"The Parkinsons Disease Biomarkers Identification Network, or PD-BIN, is an initiative developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to discover and validate biomarkers for Parkinsons disease. Biomarkers are measurable characteristics that can reveal whether the disease is developing or progressing. Biomarkers could help doctors detect Parkinsons disease before symptoms appear and improve diagnosis of the disorder."
What is (are) Problems with Smell ?,"Smell is part of our chemical sensing system. Our sense of smell is the ability to detect odors in our environment through our nose, like the fragrance of flowers or the smell of baking bread. Smell is also the ability to detect food odors or aromas released in our mouths when we chew, which then flow from the roof of the throat region to the nose. Congestion blocks this flow and impacts our appreciation of the flavor of food."
What causes Problems with Smell ?,"In rare cases, certain medicines such as antibiotics or antihistamines may cause a change in your ability to smell. If you are taking these medications and notice a change in your sense of smell, talk to your doctor. You may be able to adjust or change your medicine to one that will not cause a problem with smell."
What is (are) Surviving Cancer ?,"Follow-up cancer care involves regular medical checkups that include a review of your medical history and a physical exam. Follow-up care may include blood work and other lab tests and procedures that allow the doctor to examine or take pictures of areas inside the body. See more resources and information about follow-up care after treatment, including guidelines."
What is (are) Surviving Cancer ?,"It is important to keep a copy of your medical records to share with any new doctors that you see. This information should contain the type of cancer you were diagnosed with, test results, and treatment details. It is also essential to include information about any medical conditions, medications and supplements you take, and the doctors that you are seeing."
What are the treatments for Surviving Cancer ?,"Fatigue, or feeling extremely tired, is a common complaint during the first year after cancer treatment ends. Many factors may contribute to treatment-related fatigue, including cancer therapy or other problems such as stress, poor nutrition, and depression. Researchers are still learning about the multiple reasons for fatigue after treatment."
What are the treatments for Surviving Cancer ?,"Most people first notice symptoms, such as tingling or numbness, in their hands or feet. Other common symptoms include sudden or sharp pain sensations, loss of sensation of touch, loss of balance or difficulty walking, trouble picking up objects or buttoning clothes, and being more -- or less -- sensitive to heat and cold."
What are the treatments for Surviving Cancer ?,"Talk to your doctor when you first notice symptoms of neuropathy. Certain medications and other approaches, such as physical therapy, may help alleviate symptoms. There are some steps you can take yourself. Pay careful attention to your hands and feet, and check them for wounds. Pay attention when you walk and avoid falls. Avoid extreme heat or cold."
What are the treatments for Surviving Cancer ?,"Many cancer survivors develop problems with their mouth or teeth. Radiation or surgery to the head and neck can cause problems with your teeth and gums, the lining of your mouth, and the glands that make saliva. Certain types of chemotherapy can cause the same problems as well as dry mouth, cavities, and a change in the sense of taste."
What are the treatments for Surviving Cancer ?,"Certain kinds of chemotherapy and medicines contribute to weight gain. Unfortunately, the usual ways people try to lose weight may not work. Ask your doctor about talking with a nutritionist who can help you plan a healthy diet, and about doing exercises that can help you regain muscle tone."
What is (are) Surviving Cancer ?,"The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS) provides personalized answers to questions about many aspects of cancer, including symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship issues. Contact CIS by calling 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) or for TTY users, 1-800-332-8615.

What is (are) Paget's Disease of Bone ?,"Paget's disease of bone is a disease that causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. Our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. In Paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. The new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone."
What are the symptoms of Paget's Disease of Bone ?,"Pain may be a symptom, especially among people with more advanced Paget's disease. Affected bones also can become enlarged, misshapen, and more fragile and likely to break. Misshapen bones tend to be most noticeable in the legs, skull, and spine."
What are the complications of Paget's Disease of Bone ?,"Over time, Paget's disease may lead to other medical conditions, including arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, and nervous system problems, depending on which bones are affected. On very rare occasions, Paget's disease is associated with the development of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. Less than one percent of patients have this complication."
What are the treatments for Paget's Disease of Bone ?,"The Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow down the progression of the disease and reduce pain and other symptoms. These medications fall into two categories: bisphosphonates and calcitonin. Doctors most often prescribe one of the four strongest bisphosphonates, which are risedronate, alendronate, pamidronate, and zoledronic acid."
What are the treatments for Paget's Disease of Bone ?,Yes. Some complications from Paget's disease respond well to surgery. Joint replacement may be helpful in people with severe arthritis of the hip or knee. Surgery can also realign affected leg bones to reduce pain or help broken bones heal in a better position.
What is (are) Skin Cancer ?,"The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and produce more cells as needed to keep the body healthy. Sometimes, the process goes wrong. Cells become abnormal and form more cells in an uncontrolled way. These extra cells form a mass of tissue, called a growth or tumor. Tumors can be benign, which means not cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous."
What is (are) Skin Cancer ?,"Basal cell carcinoma develops in the basal cells of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin. It is the most common type of skin cancer in the United States, but it spreads slowly and is rarely life-threatening. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on parts of the body that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, hands and legs. However, it can be found on any part of the body."
What is (are) Skin Cancer ?,"Squamous cell carcinoma develops in the squamous cells of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin.

What are the treatments for Gum (Periodontal) Disease ?,"Treatments may include deep cleaning, medications, surgery, and bone and tissue grafts."
What are the treatments for Gum (Periodontal) Disease ?,"In deep cleaning, the dentist, periodontist, or dental hygienist removes the plaque through a method called scaling and root planing. Scaling means scraping off the tartar from above and below the gum line. Root planing gets rid of rough spots on the tooth root where the germs gather, and helps remove bacteria that contribute to the disease."
What are the treatments for Gum (Periodontal) Disease ?,"Medications may be used with treatment that includes scaling and root planing. Depending on how far the disease has progressed, the dentist or periodontist may also suggest surgical treatment. Long-term studies are needed to find out if using medications reduces the need for surgery and whether they are effective over a long period of time."
What are the treatments for Gum (Periodontal) Disease ?,"Surgery might be necessary if inflammation and deep pockets remain following treatment with deep cleaning and medications. A periodontist may perform flap surgery to remove tartar deposits in deep pockets or to reduce the periodontal pocket and make it easier for the patient, dentist, and hygienist to keep the area clean. This common surgery involves lifting back the gums and removing the tartar. The gums are then sutured back in place so that the tissue fits snugly around the tooth again."
